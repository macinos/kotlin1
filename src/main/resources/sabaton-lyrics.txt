2. Hellrider

Engines are running our blood burns like oil. Head one by
One down the highway
Tires are screaming leave trails on the road, the sirens of
Death coming our way

We’ll always be one step ahead, we’ll not fall back

Pedal to metal rock hard and ride free, the philosophy of a
Rider
Don’t use the brakes ride on faster instead, adrenaline
Taking you higher

Fall back in line or stand away, we like it fast

Into hell we ride fast as lightning, enter the darkness
The weak ones will pay
Ride through fire cause revolution, this is a hellrider’s way

Crushing the traitors to no man we kneel, the power is at
Our command
Nothing can stop us it’s head over heel, united together
We stand

If it’s to hard then you’re too weak, you’re in our way

Engines are running our blood burns like oil. Head one by
One down the highway
Tires are screaming leave trails on the road, the sirens of
Death heading our way

If you ain’t tough enough to play, get out our way


3. Endless Nights

Clouds are gathering in the darkness. Lightning strikes the
Earth. Evil forces celebrate Lucifer’s rebirth
Necromancers, sacrifices, he’ll be here for sure.
Drained blood from a thousand men, and now he’s back for more.

He will rise from a world down under
Bringing fire, plague, death and thunder
Summons creatures unknown to mankind
Demons of the past

Unholy rites. Assassins from hell
Cold endless nights upon us fell
The storm strikes our land with madness and pain
Winds of the damned drives us insane

Satan’s hordes are coming closer, now it’s time to pay
Riding on the wings of death searching for their prey
Now the time has come for mankind to prove strong or fall
Fighting against unholy creatures spawned in Satan’s hall

Trapped in hellfire he was burned
Once locked up but the wind has turned
Seeking vengeance in pain and slaughter
Back on earth again

Demons marked with the five-edged star
Haunt our dreams in this endless war
Killing children and raping women
Now it’s time to die


4. Metalizer

We live for the magic in the sound, distorted guitars are
Breaking ground
The drum pounding faster than my heart, the vocals are
screaming extreme art
The passion for metal drives us forth, the best heavy metal
comes from north
The powerful tunes, spectacular shows, the audience
screams in ecstasy

Metal, Metal
Back with the vengeance
Metal, Metal
All that I need is heavy metal
Metal
Screaming together
Metal, Metal
Metal is all that I need

While hell bends for leather we stand strong, a rocker
can party all night long
the school couldn’t teach us rock’ n roll, the school
couldn’t help us reach our goal
We live for the magic in the sound, distorted guitars are
Breaking ground
The powerful tunes, spectacular shows, the audience
Screams in ecstasy


5. Burn Your Crosses

No use to pray, there’s no one listening
I will die anyway.
Some say I’ve killed, some call me Satan
Now my blood must be spilled.

I’m sentenced for crimes I did not commit
I’ll pay with my blood, is this really it?
Creations of God? No way!

Burn your crosses, make way for science
Christ has only caused death and violence
Burn your crosses and make way for yourself
Put faith in mother earth.

Don’t call his name, don’t trust in others
Bishops fighting for fame.
Torture in vain. I won’t surrender
Purified by pain.

Mankind’s great mistake was to create God
Creation of man. Excuse to spill blood.
Creations of God? No way!

No use to pray, there’s no one listening
I will die anyway.
Leaving this place the end is near now
Dying ain’t no disgrace.

My last night alive has come to an end
Death once I feared, but now it’s my friend.
Creation of God? No way!

Burned my crosses, make way for science
Christ will only cause death and violence
Burned my crosses and made way for myself
In mother earth I trust.

NOW BURN!


6. The Hammer Has Fallen

Here I am standing, darkness all around.
Thinking of past, taken my last breath, the air is cold as ice
No one close to hear my voice
Did not leave me with a choice
Heaven will you wait for me?

Will I find a way, will I find a place
Will you let me go in peace
Will I find a way to the other side.

Sad are memories from the life I lived
Cannot go on, cannot go further
I has to end right here
For the things that I have done
All the girls I lost and won
Let me rest in peace at last

Will I find a way, will I find a place
Will you let me go in peace
Leave behind those dark days
No I ask again will you hear my cries
Then you realize why oh why
I must find a way to the other side.

Hear them whisper calling out my name
The sentences is set, the hammer has fallen
I have paid the price
Sad to realize to late death was meant to be my fate
All this pain will follow me.


7. Hail To The King

Once we lived in harmony, but it seems so distance now.
Even though it wasn’t long ago, were all doomed to
Plague and death. Working hard from dawn ‘til dusk. but
That ain’t enough for him Product of unholy love, untrue
Brother of a king.

Know that you’ll fail, now hear us hail
Your brother that you killed.

Hail to the king that brought peace to us all. Rise from
Your grave, hear our call. We’ll not forget that you once
Saved our land. Killed by your own brothers hand.

Pure evil and cruelty, the true nature of your soul.
Mercy and responsibility, words that you can’t understand.
Your quest for total control will only end in your own fall.
We’ will fight for our freedom, and our right to live.

Do it your way, soon you will pay
Debts with your own blood.

Stars so bright, dance in the night
Day come soon, hide the moon
Stars so bright dance in the night
Day come soon, killing the moon

Morning breaks it’s time to march, to the castle of betrayal.
Bring your sword, wield your armour, we won’t take this anymore.
Kill the tyrant he must die, for his falseness and his crimes.
Strike him down, and slay his guards, and his ministers as well.

Done it your way, now you will pay
Debts with your own blood.

Hail to the king!


8. Shadows

Facing the wind as they ride through the sky
Shadows of Mordor black horses they fly
Black shadow king, find the ring.

Search for the Halfling you lords of the dark
The hobbit with Sauron's ring he is your mark
Unholy light, in the night

Black knights of Sauron
You’re made of iron
Black shadows of Mordor
Wield one-eyed shields

Unholy ring wraiths with armour of steel
Kings of the past to no one you kneel
Hearts filled with hate, that’s your fate.

Facing the wind as they ride through the sky
Shadows of Mordor black horses they fly
Ride shadow king, find the ring.


9. Thunderstorm

Crack in the distance, a flash in the sky
It’s getting dark, clouds gather power
You heard it coming from over the hill
It’s time to run, time to seek cover.

Now there is no hideaway
And you have no chance
Thor and his hammer are riding his chariots of storm

Breaking the silence with powerful roars
Wind gaining strength, screaming tornado
First wave is over, don’t hold back your breath
It sure coming back, second attack

Now there is no hideaway
And you have no chance
The sky is on fire the heavens are burning in flames

THUNDER
THUNDER
STRIKING
THUNDER

A cold rain is falling, a lightning strikes down
Distance is dark, horizon is frightening
Massive strong lightning’s are shaking the ground
Thor is upset, out slaying giants

Now there is no hideaway
And you have no chance
Thor and his hammer are out slaying giants tonight.


10. Masters Of The World

We’re a small crowd left to rotten, there’s not many hard souls left
As the pop is growing stronger, will metal fade away

Will we be broken, will we go down?

No! We’ll never fall we’re the masters of the world
Get up let’s break those chains now and party all night long
No! We’ll never fall we’re the masters of the world
Get up let’s break those chains now and party all night long

As I’m tweaking with my radio, there’s disco everywhere
When I turn on my big TV, is hip hop what I want to see?

Have we been broken, did we go down?


11. Guten Nacht

[bonus track]


12. Birds Of War

[bonus track]

The priesthood is trembling
the five knights of light has betrayed mankind
Now known as the dark ones
we strike down on earth with powers from hell

We ride on the wind we ride through the sky
like unholy birds of war we fly
we bring agony and insanity
Once blessed by the light now serving the night
and soon cursed by every man on earth
We follow our lust, in no god we trust

Come join us
Leave this world behind and you will find satisfaction
fight on our side you cannot hide from us forever more

Once greeted as heroes
now treated as foes wherever we go
Recruiting more warriors
the hordes of undead march on our command

Now mankind will pay from this very day
every man on earth will curse his birth
We spread fear and pain resistance in vain
We march in the dark your kind is our mark
avoid the daylight in dark we fight
We'll control your souls you'll end up like ghouls

1. Primo Victoria

Through the gates of hell
As we make our way to heaven
Through the Nazi lines
Primo victoria

We've been training for years
Now we're ready to strike
As the great operation begins
We're the first wave on the shore
We're the first ones to fall
Yet soldiers have fallen before

In the dawn they will pay
With their lives as the price
History's written today
In this burning inferno
Know that nothing remains
As our forces advance on the beach

Aiming for heaven though serving in hell
Victory is ours their forces will fall

Through the gates of hell
As we make our way to heaven
Through the Nazi lines
Primo victoria

On the 6th of June
On the shores of western Europe 1944
D-day upon us

We've been here before
Used to this kind of war
Crossfire grind through the sand
Our orders were easy
It's kill or be killed
Blood on both sides will be spilled

In the dawn they will pay
With their lives as the price
History's written today
Now that we are at war
With the axis again
This time we know what will come

6th of June 1944
Allies are turning the war
Normandy state of anarchy
Overlord


2. Reign Of Terror

The sky is on fire burning black gold
Eyes of the west turn to east
Driven by greed and an urge to destroy
Merciless killing your own

Slave to the power a slave to the gold
Ruthlessly ruling the east
Your reing of terror must come to an end
Fighting your unholy war

[Pre-chorus:]
Now you will pay we'll charge you our way
Sooner or later we'll get you
Don't try to hide in your holes underground
Just like an insect we'll smoke you right out

[Chorus:]
Night time primetime
Ancient legacy of crime
One day we will make you pay for

Night time primetime
Law and order pays the fine
Genocide you cannot justify

Chaos in east disorder in west
Desert storm is a go
Fighters are launched from the carriers at sea
Infantry coming your way

Armoured brigades engaging their lines
Regain control of black gold
Your reign of terror will come to an end
Forcing you out of control

Countdown to death we're coming for you
Making our way through the desert
Soon you will pay for the pain that you caused
Captured or dead you will cause no more
Harm

[Chorus]

Feet after feet mile after mile
Allies regaining control
Your cities in ruins a people in need
Still you go on as before

Feet after feet mile after mile
Allies returning the land
Hide underground as the coward you are
One day we're coming for you

[Pre-chorus]
[Chorus]


3. Panzer Battalion

Under this sun no shadows will fall
Piercing our eyes as we charge
An armoured battalion on course to the east
Closing the end of it's march

This time we're here to finish a job
Started a decade ago
Driving the animals out of their holes
To bury them 6 feet below
Armoured tanks of mass destruction
Killers in the east
Rats who dares to stand before us
Feel our guns go live

[Chorus:]
Death in the shape of a panzer battalion
Insect of terror don't run face your fate like a
Man cannot outrun our panzer battalion

Thousands of tons of armour and guns
Making it's way through the sand
Our panzer battalion is back for revenge
Artillery sweeping the land

First strike is ours no mercy is shown
There's rivers of blood in our track
Breaking their waves of defence with our tanks
Infantry watching our back

Blow their SAM sites clear for air strike
Ready for the storm
Minefields swept there's no surrender
Feel our napalm burn

[Chorus x2]

Under this sun no shadows will fall
Piercing our eyes as we charge
An armoured battalion on course to the east
Has reached the end of it's march

Armoured tanks of mass destruction
Killers in the east
Rats who dares to stand before us
Feel our guns go live

Panzer battalion
Insect of terror don't run face your fate like a man
Panzer battalion


4. Wolfpack

To their own shore came the world war
Gleaves and Ingham
Leading the bury west

Took the short way in
The long route back convoy 92
Bury Gleaves and Ingham leading
Tankers to the west
And upon the north Atlantic
Lies the silence of the seas
On a quietst night in the darkest hour
The kriegsmarine appear

Above the surface it seems quiet and calm
Deep down below the wolfpack lurks

[Chorus:]
To their own shore came the world war
Gleaves and Ingham
Leading the bury west
In their own track came the wolfpack
Gleaves led the conwoy
Into the hornets nest

At the crack of dawn the second day
Bury stands in flames
Half the convoy sunk or disabled
Heading back to shore
But below the north Atlantic
On the bottom of the sea
On the second night in the darkest hour
The kriegsmarine return

The wolfpack surface for a second time
To make the convoy face it's fate

[Chorus]

Under fire under water
May 42 when
Bury did fail the test
To their own shore came the world war
Gleaves and the Ingham
Leading them into death

569 makes the contact and lead them
U-94 scores a kill in the dark
124 sinking 4 in 2 approaches
406 suffers failure on launch [x2]

In their own track came the wolfpack
Gleaves led the conwoy
Into the hornets nest

To their own shore came the world war
Gleaves and Ingham
Leading the bury west
In their own track came the wolfpack
Gleaves led the conwoy
Into the hornets nest

Under fire under water
May 42 when
Bury did fail the test
To their own shore came the world war
Gleaves and the Ingham
Leading them into death

Don't know what's waiting down below
The Wolfpack lurks, awaiting you
To follow, to bleed
It's time for you to return
They decide, oh no! Oh no!
The Wolfpack's waiting for them
Too calm, you'll see
Below the surface, waits for you


5. Counterstrike

Kickstart fighter launch
Throttle set to full
Speed king race to win
Afterburners roaring

Ghostlike counterstrike
Takes them by surprise

Score 307
Israelis rule the heaven

Jordan attacks Israel crush that
Futile attempt
Control Jerusalem

Drive back surprise attack
Take the western wall
Next day make them pay
Over river Jordan

Syria last in line
Head for golan heights
Strike without a warning
See the Syria forces falling

Syria attacks Israel crushed their
Lines of defence
Ruling golan heights

[Chorus:]
6 days of fire 1 day of rest
June 67 taught them respect
Control Jerusalem

3 nations fallen in 6 days of war
Traitorous neighbours
Received as deserved
Under the sun in the dust of the war
1 nation standing stronger than before

First into Egypt and
Sent them to hell
Then turned their forces to Jordan
Climb up the mountains
Where Syria awaits
Break them in hours
Protect holy land

[Chorus x2]


6. Stalingrad

Fresh from Moscow
Over Volga came to comrades aid
City in despair
Almost crushed by the führers army

Oh it's colder than hell
Hitlers forces advancing

The sound of mortars
The music of death
A grand symphony

See your friends fall hear them
Pray to the god your country denies
Every man dies alone and when your
Time comes you will know that it's time

Stalins fortress on fire
Is this madness or hell

[Chorus:]
The sound of the mortars
The music of death
We're playing the devils symphony
Our violins are guns
Conducted from hell

Oh Stalingrad
Mratnimiat

Are you playing
Do you follow the conductors lead
No one knows you
No one cares about a single violin

Play the score of the damned
Know the devil within

[Chorus]


7. Into The Fire

Sent from home overseas
And into the unknown
Barely landed in the jungle
Sent on first patrol

Sundown darkness falls
Dig in for the night
Ambushed in the dawn they came
The jungle's alive

I feel my fire starts to burn
The heat controlling my mind
Berserk a savage running wild
Within me the beast starts to roar

[Chorus:]
Now I'm ready to strike
A creature of the night
Into the fire
The flame of napalm strike

Sarge's down I'm in charge
Vc's everywhere
Overrun yet order airstrike
Condemned us all to burn

Napalm from above
Burning friend and foe
Chaos on the battlefield
The jungle's on fire

This place it's driving me insane
Napalm it's burning us all
This fight no man will live to tell
Within me my blood starts to boil

[Chorus]

From above the airstrike came
And it burned the world below
Napalm falling from the sky
And it leaves no man alive

I feel my fire starts to burn
The heat controlling my mind
Napalm it's burning us alive
Within me the beasts final roar

[Chorus]


8. Purple Heart

When we signed up for the army
To a rangers company
Armed with M16's
Straight into the war

Then we served under the banner
Clad in US stars an stripes
And on moonless nights
We marched for endless miles

[Chorus:]
Once we were soldiers
Once we were young
We have found our peace
We've seen the end

Fallen in war
We belong to history
Fallen in war
Sleep 6 feet below

Hearts of the brave
Cannot bring me back to life
Fallen in war
Still brothers in arms

We have fought in distant conflict
And for all to many years
Seen our friends go down
Wounded dead or lost

Know that peace comes at a high price
It may take a thousand lives
And a deep belief
Sacrifice of men

[Chorus]

Shining heart beats no more
Buried deep deep in cold earth
Shallow grave in my motherland
Here I stay in darkness forever

Fallen in war
We belong to history
Fallen in war
Sleep 6 feet below

Hearts of the brave
Cannot bring me back to life
Fallen in war
Still brothers in arms


9. Metal Machine

I have a phobia
A fear of the dark
Afraid to shoot strangers
The animal talks

Guns scare me shitless
But love gun's my friend
The sentinel's coming
But is this the end?

Riding on this crazy train
I'm going paranoid
Watch me lose my mind
And break the law (breaking the law, breaking the law)

I'm a metal machine
It's close to midnight and
He's barking at the moon
I'm a metal machine
The rainbow in the dark is shining
I'm only metal machine
It's close to midnight and
He's barking at the moon
I'm a metal machine
The kings of metal ride the sky

Is this st. anger
The ultimate sin
Or have I really
A black knight within?

The gates of Babylon
Are open and wide
Shout at the devil
There's nowhere to hide

Fighting for the world to keep
The wild child in it's cage
Broke my metal heart
Against the wall (against the wall)

I'm a metal machine
It's close to midnight and
He's barking at the moon
I'm only metal machine
The rainbow in the dark is shining
I'm a metal machine
It's close to midnight and
He's barking at the moon
Come touch my metal machine
The kings of metal ride the sky

[Solo]

Come touch my metal machine
It's close to midnight and
He's barking at the moon
I'm a metal machine
The rainbow in the dark is shining
Come touch metal machine
It's close to midnight and
He's barking at the moon
I’m a metal machine
The kings of metal ride the sky

I know my metal machine
It's close to midnight and
He's barking at the moon
I'm a metal machine
The rainbow in the dark is shining
Come touch my metal machine
No we will never fall
We're masters of the world
Come suck my metal machine
No we will never fall
We're masters of the...

1. Attero Dominatus

Attero!
Dominatus!
Berlin is burning
Denique!
Interimo!
The reich has fallen

We stand at the gates of Berlin
With two and a half million men
With six thousand tanks in our ranks
Use them as battering rams

Artillery leading our way
A million grenades has been launched
The nazis must pay for their crimes
The wings of the eagle has been broken

Marshall Zhukov's orders:
Serve me Berlin on a plate!
Disregard the losses
The city is ours to take

The price of a war must be payed
Millions of lives has been lost
The price must be paid by the men
That started the war in the 30's

The spring of the year 45'
The year when the nazis will fall
We're inside the gates of Berlin
The beak of the eagle is broken

Comrade Stalins orders:
Serve me it's head on a plate
Disregard the losses
The eagle's land is ours to take

March!
Fight!
Die!
In Berlin!
March!
Fight!
Conquer!
Berlin!


2. Nuclear Attack

Dropped from Enola, a city erased, threat of the future displayed
A power unheard of a power unseen
Flash out of nowhere, the sky is burning

At 8:16 AM Tokyo control realized something was wrong
Reports of explosions, destruction and pain
Air raid from hell city gone in a blaze

August in black, B-29's coming back

Prepare for nuclear attack
Warned but did not heed
Prepare for nuclear attack
Extermination
Strike back
Chose not to believe
Another nuclear attack

From the southeast came the second attack, threat of tomorrow unveiled
11:02 on the 9th of August
Over the valley, like ball lightning

The bomb detonates and the land turns to waste, barren for decades to come
The factories burning, the steelworks destroyed
Surrender your war else you'll perish in flames

Second attack, B-29's turning back.


3. Rise Of Evil

A nation in despair, weakened by war, defeated
Lost their pride in Versailles
A former prisoner, with a vision or a grand delusion
Rise to power in the reich

Rebuilding an army
Make the nation proud
Disregarding the treaty
Secret plans for "lebensraum"
Start the holocaust

The reich will rise
Propaganda, the reich will rise
To last a thousand years

Burning books to spread, anti-semite propaganda
Who will stop the madman's reign?
Night of broken glass, send the Jews to Dachau death camp
On a path to certain death

The "anschluss" completed
On the brink of war
Act brutal with no pity
Be harsh, show no remorse
Start the warmachine

In the last days of peace
Europe holding it's breath
An invasion is coming but when will it start?
Who will be first to fall? who will be last to stand?
Who will stop all this madness that has consequences no man understand?
No man, no land!


4. In The Name Of God

Hide from the public eye, choose to appear when it suits you
Claim you're just, killing women and children
Fight, when you choose to fight, hide in a cave when you're hunted
Like a beast spawned from hell, utilizing fear

Chosen by god or a coward insane?
Stand up and show me your face!

Suicidal, in a trance
A religious army
Fight without a uniform and hide in the crowd
Call it holy, call it just
Authorized by heaven
Leave your wounded as they die, and call it gods will

Run when its time to pay, fear consequence of your action
Reappear, when you're almost forgotten
Dream of a world in peace, yet you cause pain and destruction
Kill your own, a response of your actions

Captured in all you lies, fear is in your eyes
Creature who's gone insane, your war is in vain
Trapped in a cage of stone, we'll destroy your home
Consequence of your action


5. We Burn

I've had a vision its clear to me now
I know what has to be done
Different religions cannot share a land
A plague and I have the cure

Chase them down, let them suffer in pain
Dig them down, they´ll be gone for a while
Evidence lost

We burn
Plunder and rape
Show them no mercy, just burn
Flesh turn to ash

Inspired by deeds that were done long ago
I know what has to be done
Filth of my land must be washed clean and pure
Now let the cleansing begin

Genocide?
Who will drag me to court?
There´s no crime if you do not get caught
I am the law. We burn

Privates, sergeants and generals hear
It's our chance we've been waiting too long
Your orders are: to start to burn


6. Angels Calling

Sent to kill, to watch no man's land
Snipers are moving unseen
Fight for land, to lose it again
Shrapnel is filling the air

Hell on earth, the trenches mean death, better keep your head down low
Charge their lines, the ultimate test it's a synchronized sacrifice

Get the wounded after dark
Left alone in no man's land
Maddening chaos at the front

Dream of heaven
Angels are calling your name

Shells and guns, a rifle and scope
Bullets are wearing your name
Losing track of time and of space
Midnight at sanity's edge

Losing friends to artillery shells, at the break of dawn
Break their will, as yours has been broken, they're here alone, dream of home

Charge at dawn to gain a yard
Scout at night to guard their lines
Leave your life in fortunes hand

When the bullet hits it's mark
Know your time in hell has been served
You won't return to home


7. Back In Control

Sent to the islands to secure what is ours
Marching ashore in the cover of night
Hide until dawn and attack in the twilight
Shake them awake with the thunder of guns

Orders from the iron maiden, get the islands back
Failure will not be accepted, call for artillery strike, launch attack

We are Back in control, force them to surrender
Take what is ours, restore law and order
Back in control, push them further out to sea
Falklands in our hands, back under British reign

Push them back further and out from the islands
Into our fleet that will stop their retreat
Mark their positions and call in the airforce
Harriers and Vulcans strikes at our command


8. A Light In The Black

A cry for help, a distant whisper
A foreign nation calling our name
Sent to hell, to reach for heaven
To serve in dark, as light in the black

Sent into battle to aid strangers in need
Gain independence, our forces will lead
Final solution when all others have failed
Liberation is coming our path has been laid

We remember the fields, where our tanks held the line
We remember our brothers in arms

When the war, has been won
And our march home begins
What awaits has not yet been revealed
What was won? what was lost?
Will our deeds be remembered?
Are they written on stone or in sand?

Marching ashore, our target awaits
Facing resistance, forces driven by hate
Protecting civilians, while fired upon
Rules of engagement, our restrictions are gone

We remember the sea, where our ships broke the waves
We remember our brothers in arms

Leaving home, set to sea
Was this really meant to be?
See the shore of our home fade away
Facing blood, facing pain
Have our brothers died in vain?
Many lives has been lost on the way


9. Metal Crüe

Take some venom and accept
That you won't see Nazareth
The rainbow leads you home

Warrior sent to milky way
UFO shooting gamma ray
A riot of destruction

Watch the rockbitch go down, vixen spread

When the priest killed a maiden in the metal church
Armored saints and warlocks watched the slaughter
Rage of the slayer forced the pretty maids
To kiss the Queen in crimson glory

You were born a motorhead
Bike's in flames you race ahead
U do the Kansas rush

Racing with the motley crew
Annihilator chasing you
With guns and burning roses

Status quo has been reached, wasps unleashed

Take a skyride with me, then you'll see

1. Hellrider

Engines are running our blood burns like oil.
Head one by one down the highway
Tires are screaming leave trails on the road, the sirens of death coming our way

We'll always be one step ahead, we'll not fall back

Pedal to metal rock hard and ride free, the philosophy of a rider
Don't use the brakes ride on faster instead, adrenaline taking you higher

Fall back in line or stand away, we like it fast

Into hell we ride fast as lightning, enter the darkness
The weak ones will pay
Ride through fire cause revolution, this is a hellrider's way

Crushing the traitors to no man we kneel, the power is at our command
Nothing can stop us it's head over heel, united together we stand

If it's to hard then you're too weak, you're in our way

If you ain't tough enough to play, get out our way


2. Thundergods

Hear the rolling sound of thunder
As the battle rages on
We will tear this world us under
Feel our power

Through a darkened sky we riding
Pierce the night with bolts of light

We will find you although you are hiding
Under cover

We will break through with

Thunder and fire
Realising an unholy
Hellborn, desire
We are out of control
To conquer this world

From a world you broken into
From a world unknown to man
We release our wrath upon you
Holy bloodshed

Breaking chains of your religion
Worship none or be destroyed
You cannot defeat our legion
Bleed the world red

We will break through with

Thunder and fire
Realising an unholy
Hellborn, desire
We are out of control
To conquer this world

Lightning bolts of anger
Raging in your world
We uphold the darkness
Rulers of the moonlight

As you think its over
Calm has settled in
Thundergods returning
Back to rule this planet again

Future role of generations
Let us rage into this world
They'll be trusting our patience
Run for cover
Hear the rolling sound of thunder
As the battle rages on
We will tear this world us under
Feel our power


3. Metalizer

We live for the magic in the sound, distorted guitars are breaking ground
The drum pounding faster than my heart, the vocals are screaming extreme art
The passion for metal drives us forth, the best heavy metal comes from north

The powerful tunes, spectacular shows, the audience screams in ecstasy

Metal, Metal
Back with the vengeance
Metal, Metal
All that I need is heavy metal
Metal
Screaming together
Metal, Metal
Metal is all that I need

While hell bends for leather we stand strong, a rocker can party all night long
the school couldn't teach us rock' n roll, the school couldn't help us reach our goal
We live for the magic in the sound, distorted guitars are breaking ground

The powerful tunes, spectacular shows, the audience screams in ecstasy


4. Shadows

Facing the wind as they ride through the sky
Shadows of Mordor black horses they fly
Black shadow king, find the ring.
Search for the Halfling you lords of the dark
The hobbit with Sauron's ring he is your mark
Unholy light, in the night

Black knights of Sauron
You're made of iron
Black shadows of Mordor
Wield one-eyed shields

Unholy ring wraiths with armour of steel
Kings of the past to no one you kneel
Hearts filled with hate, that's your fate.
Facing the wind as they ride through the sky
Shadows of Mordor black horses they fly
Ride shadow king, find the ring.


5. Burn Your Crosses

No use to pray, there's no one listening
I will die anyway.
Some say I've killed, some call me Satan
Now my blood must be spilled

I'm sentenced for crimes I did not commit
I'll pay with my blood, is this really it?
Creations of God?
No way!

Burn your crosses, make way for science
Christ has only caused death and violence
Burn your crosses and make way for yourself
Put faith in mother earth.

Don't call his name, don't trust in others
Bishops fighting for fame.
Torture in vain. I won't surrender
Purified by pain.

Mankind's great mistake was to create God
Creation of man. Excuse to spill blood.
Creations of God?
No way!

No use to pray, there's no one listening
I will die anyway.
Leaving this place the end is near now
Dying ain't no disgrace

My last night alive has come to an end
Death once I feared, but now it's my friend.
Creation of God?
No way!

Burned my crosses, make way for science
Christ will only cause death and violence
Burned my crosses and made way for myself
In mother earth I trust.

NOW BURN!


6. 7734

The dawn of time breaks
See the sun rise to the sky
The wheel of time begins to turn

But then we heard it
A divine voice out of nowhere
Spoke to our hearts and showed the way

Almighty lord we have come to your hall
Do glatem live, creator of all
Open your heart and you will find a way
Paradise calling and enter you may

Falling down
Now your soul returns to paradise
7734

The wheel kept turning, ages came
Time passed us by
We lived in perfect harmony
But then it happened
Our ranks decreased rapidly
But now its time for our return

Once we were numerous
But that's long ago
We are no longer 7734
We last 2united and 2 became 1
111 perished in flames


7. Endless Nights

Clouds are gathering in the darkness.
Lightning strikes the Earth.
Evil forces celebrate, Lucifer's rebirth

Necromancers, sacrifices, he'll be here for sure.
Drained blood from a thousand men, and now he's back for more.

He will rise from a world down under
Bringing fire, plague, death and thunder
Summons creatures unknown to mankind
Demons of the past

Unholy rites. Assassins from hell
Cold endless nights upon us fell
The storm strikes our land with madness and pain
Winds of the damned drives us insane

Satan's hordes are coming closer, now it's time to pay
Riding on the wings of death searching for their prey
Now the time has come for mankind to prove strong or fall
Fighting against unholy creatures spawned in Satan's hall

Trapped in hellfire he was burned
Once locked up but the wind has turned
Seeking vengeance in pain and slaughter
Back on earth again

Demons marked with the five-edged star
Haunt our dreams in this endless war
Killing children and raping women
Now it's time to die


8. Hail To The King

Once we lived in harmony, but it seems so distance now.
Even though it wasn't long ago, were all doomed to plague and death.
Working hard from dawn 'til dusk.
But that ain't enough for him
Product of unholy love, untrue brother of a king.

Know that you'll fail, now hear us hail
Your brother that you killed.

Hail to the king that brought peace to us all.
Rise from your grave, hear our call.
We'll not forget that you once saved our land.
Killed by your own brothers hand.

Pure evil and cruelty, the true nature of your soul
Mercy and responsibility, words that you can't understand.
Your quest for total control will only end in your own fall.
We' will fight for our freedom, and our right to live.

Do it your way, soon you will pay
Debts with your own blood.

Stars so bright, dance in the night
Day come soon, hide the moon
Stars so bright dance in the night
Day come soon, killing the moon

Morning breaks it's time to march, to the castle of betrayal.
Bring your sword, wield your armour, we won't take this anymore.
Kill the tyrant he must die, for his falseness and his crimes.
Strike him down, and slay his guards, and his ministers as well.

Done it your way, now you will pay
Debts with your own blood.


9. Thunderstorm

Crack in the distance, a flash in the sky
It's getting dark, clouds gather power
You heard it coming from over the hill
It's time to run, time to seek cover.

Now there is no hideaway
And you have no chance
Thor and his hammer are riding his chariots of storm

Breaking the silence with powerful roars
Wind gaining strength, screaming tornado
First wave is over, don't hold back your breath
It sure coming back, second attack

Now there is no hideaway
And you have no chance
The sky is on fire the heavens are burning in flames

THUNDER
THUNDER
STRIKING
THUNDER

A cold rain is falling, a lightning strikes down
Distance is dark, horizon is frightening
Massive strong lightning's are shaking the ground
Thor is upset, out slaying giants

Now there is no hideaway
And you have no chance
Thor and his hammer are out slaying giants tonight.


10. Speeder

Born with a heart of a lion, raving to space on your own.
Into the belt of Orion, g-forces bite to the bone

Speed makes your heart burn like fire
Speed makes your heart burn with lust

Challenges taking you higher
Ride fast and do what you want

Fast as the lightning, your life is at stake
You're the one that

Speeder, Speeder
Faster and higher, exciting desire.
Speeder, Speeder
G-forces bite to the bone

Out of this world you are racing
Into an asteroid belt
Challenges of death you are facing
Strongest kick you ever felt

Faster than light, ride through the night
No way to stop this machine
Asses have turned never return
Search for the world of your dream


11. Masters Of The World

We're a small crowd left to rotten, there's not many hard souls left
As the pop is growing stronger, will metal fade away?

Will we be broken, will we go down?

No! We'll never fall we're the masters of the world
Get up let's break those chains now and party all night long
No! We'll never fall we're the masters of the world
Get up let's break those chains now and party all night long

As I'm tweaking with my radio, there's disco everywhere
When I turn on my big TV, is hip hop what I want to see?

Have we been broken, did we go down?


12. Jawbreaker

[bonus track: Judas Priest Cover]

Deadly as the viper
Peering from its coil
The poison there is coming to the boil

Ticking like a time bomb
The fuse is running short
on the verge of snapping if it's caught

And all the pressure that's been building up
For all the years it bore the load
The cracks appear, the frame starts to distort
Ready to explode -- Jawbreaker

Crouching in the corner
Wound up as a spring
Piercing eyes that flash are shimmering

Muscles are all contorted
Claws dug in the dirt
Every ounce of fiber on alert

And all the pressure that's been building up
For all the years it bore the load
The cracks appear, the frame starts to distort
Ready to explode -- Jawbreaker
Jawbreaker...

And all the pressure that's been building up
For all the years it bore the load
The cracks appear, the frame starts to distort
Ready to explode -- Jawbreaker

Jawbreaker
Jawbreaker
Jawbreaker...

1. Sun Tzu Says

"Sun Tzu said: The art of war is of vital importance to the State.
It is a matter of life and death, a road either to safety or to ruin."


2. Ghost Division

Fast as the wind, the invasion has begun
Shaking the ground with the force of thousand guns
First in the line of fire, first into hostile land
Tanks leading the way, leading the way

Charging the lines with the force of a furious storm
Fast as the lighting phantoms swarm
200 miles at nightfall, taken within a day
Thus earning their name, earning the fame

[Chorus:]
They are the panzer elite, born to compete, never retreat (ghost division)
Leaving our dead, always ahead, fed by your dread

Always ahead, as the blitzkrieg rages on
Breaking morale the with the sound of blazing guns
First in the line of fire, first into hostile land
Tanks leading the way, leading the way

Leaving a trail of destruction to a foreign land
(Waging war with conviction)
Massive assault made to serve the Nazi plan
(Wehrmacht's pride, ghost division)
Communication's broken, phantoms are far away
Thus earning their name, earning the fame

[Chorus]

Pushing the frontline forth with a tremendous force
(Far ahead, breaks resistance)
Making the way for panzer corps
(Shows no fear, self-subsistent)
First in the line of fire, first into hostile land
Tanks leading the way, claiming the fame

[Chorus]

Panzer elite, born to compete, never retreat (ghost division)
Leaving our dead, always ahead, fed by your dread


3. The Art Of War

I stand alone
And gaze upon the battlefield
Wasteland
Is all that's left after the fight
And I'm searching a new way to defeat my enemy
Bloodshed
I've seen enough of death and pain

[Pre-chorus 1:]
I will run - they will hunt me in vain
I will hide - they'll be searching
I'll regroup - feign retreat they'll pursue
Coup de grâce I will win but never fight [mercy killing]
That's the Art of War!

Breaking the will to fight among the enemy
Force them to hunt me
They will play my game
And play by my rules
I will be close but still untouchable
No more will I see suffering and pain
They will find me no more
I'll be gone

I will have them surrounded
They will yield without fight overrun

Overrun
Coup de grâce

I will win but never fight
That's the Art of War

Broken and lost
Tired of war
They'll surrender to me
Caught in my trap
There's no way out
Fail never again

[Pre-chorus 1]


4. 40:1

Baptised in fire.
Forty to one

So silent before the storm
Awaiting command
A few has been chosen to stand
As one outnumbered by far
The orders from high command
Fight back, hold your ground!

In early September it came
A war unknown to the world
No army may enter that land
That is protected by polish hand
Unless you are forty to one
Your force will soon be undone

Baptised in fire
Forty to one
Spirit of spartans
Death and glory
Soldiers of Poland
Second to none
Wrath of the Wehrmacht brought to a halt

The 8th of September it starts
The rage of the Reich
A barrage of mortars and guns
Stand past, the bunkers will hold
The captain has pledged his life
I'll face my fate here!
The sound of artillery strike
So fierce
The thunder of guns

So come, bring on all that you've got
Come hell, come high water, never stop
Unless you are forty to one
Your lives will soon be undone

Baptised in fire
40 to 1
Spirit of spartans
Death and glory
Soldiers of poland
Second to none
Wrath of the Wehrmacht brought to a halt

Always remember, a fallen soldier
Always remember, fathers and sons at war
Always remember, a fallen soldier
Always remember, fathers and sons at war
Always remember, a fallen soldier
Always remember, buried in history

No vermin may enter that land
That is protected by polish hand
Unless you are forty to one
Your force will soon be undone

Baptised in fire
Forty to one
Spirit of spartans
Death and glory!
Soldiers of Poland
Second to none
Wrath of the Wehrmacht brought to a halt

No, no, no


5. Unbreakable

It's under crimson skies hell's horizon
Our trap will spring
Unaware of our presence they'll be marching
Straight to their doom

We are prepared for war ready to fire
Stand by to charge
Counting down as they march into destruction
Their time has come

They'll never know we give no warning
We set a trap they took the bait
Leading them straight into hell

They will not live to tell the tale
We'll strike at dusk and fight 'til dawn
Tonight our foe is bound to fail
Our time is now all ready at arms

Upon our chosen ground dead men marching
No sign of hope
Victory will be ours before the dawn breaks
Tonight we charge

Chaos and disorder sound of the attack
Charging down the mountain frontal assault
Guns light up the darkness mortars rip the ground
Like a force of nature shaking the field

They'll never know we give no warning
We set a trap they took the bait
Cut off retreat

Released
Unleashed
The beast within berserker rage is
Released
Unleashed
A storm a force unbreakable warmachine

Victims of the ambush
Stains the ground with blood
Fields of execution murderous plan
Soldiers turn to madmen in the dead of night
Fighting with a fury fiery eyes


6. The Nature Of Warfare

"Water shapes its course according to the nature of the ground over which it flows; the soldier works out his victory in relation to the foe whom he is facing.
Therefore, just as water retains no constant shape, so in warfare there are no constant conditions."


7. Cliffs Of Gallipoli

Hear them whisper,
Voices from the other side
Hear them calling
Former foes now friends are resting side by side

They will never leave our hearts or fade away
Live forever
They were far too young to die in such a way

How many wasted lives
How many dreams did fade away
Broken promises
They won't be coming home

Oh mothers wipe your tears
Your sons will rest a million years
Found their peace at last
As foe turned to friend
And forgive
And they knew they'd die

Gallipoli
Left their letters in the sand
Such waste of life
Gallipoli
Dreams of freedom turned to dust

Hell is waiting where the ocean meets the sand
Cliffs of burden
Where the soldiers rushed into a certain death

At the shoreline
Blood of heroes stains the land
Light a candle
One for each of them who fought and died in vain

There is no enemy
There is no victory
Only boys who lost their lives in the sand
Young men were sacrificed
Their names are carved in stone and kept alive
And forever we will honour the memory of them
And they knew they would die

Gallipoli
Left their letters in the sand
Such waste of life
Gallipoli
Dreams of freedom turned to dust

Oh mothers wipe your tears
Your sons will rest a million years
Found their peace at last
As foe turned to friend
And forgive
And they knew they would die

Gallipoli
Left their letters in the sand
Such waste of life
Gallipoli
Dreams of freedom turned to dust


8. Talvisota

Rise of nations pride

Russians on a route to ruin
Kreml is more then certain to win
Sent away an army to the west

Blizzard reigned the ground were chosen
Snow was deep and hell were frozen
Stalin were too eager to invade

He thought of the might he possessed
And not of his foe
Rage of winter

Rise, nations pride
Hold whats yours
Strike'em were it hurts

Fight, hold your ground
Winter war
Reinforce the line

Split them into small divisions
Rip 'em of the conquest visions
Motti tactics used with great result

Snipers move unseen in snowfall
Force them to retreat and recall
Fight the Russian rule and their demand

With Molotov cocktail in hand
No fear of their tanks
Death or glory

A slice of a knife to a throat
And their blood turns to ice
TALVISOTA!


9. Panzerkampf

Into the motherland
The German army march

In the Soviet Union summer 1943
Tanks line up in thousands as far the eye can see
Ready for the onslaught
Ready for the fight
Waiting for the axis to march into a trap
Mines are placed in darkness
In the cover of the night
Waiting to be triggered
When the time is right
Imminent invasion, imminent attack

Once the battle started
There's no turning back

The end of the third Reich draws near
It's time has come to an end
The end of an era is here
It's time to attack!

[Chorus:]
Into the motherland the German army march
Comrades stand side by side to stop the Nazi charge
Panzers on Russian soil a thunder in the east
One million men at war
Soviet wrath unleashed!

Fields of Prokhorovka
Where the heat of battle burned
Suffered heavy losses
And the tide of war was turned
Driving back the Germans
Fighting on four fronts
Hunt them out of Russia
Out of Soviet land
Reinforce the front line
Force the axis to retreat
Send in all the reserves
Securing their defeat
Soldiers of the Union
Broke the citadel
Ruins of an army
Axis rest in hell

The end of the third Reich draws near
Its time has come to an end
The end of an era is here
Its time to attack

[Chorus]

Onward comrads! Onwards for the Soviet Union! Charge!

Ow mother Russia!
Union of lands
Will of the people
Strong in command
Ow mother Russia!
Union of lands
Once more victorious the red army stands!

The end of the third Reich is here
Its time has come to an end
The end of an era is here
Its time to attack!

[Chorus]


10. Union (Slopes Of St. Benedict)

As a turn of the tide
It is our turn to rise
The force of a union at war
March over the mountains
On our way to the north
On the road that will lead us to Rome
Our way will not be easy
It will take us through hardship and pain
Hill after hill breaking their line of defense
Head at north

Mile after mile our march carries on
No army may stop our approach
Fight side by side
Many nations unite
At the shadow of Monte Cassino
We fight and die together
As we head for the valley of death
Destiny calls
We'll not surrender or fail

To arms!
Under one banner
As a unit we stand
And united we fall -
As one fighting together
Bringing the end to the slaughter
Winds are changing
Head at north!


11. The Price Of A Mile

Hear the sound of a machinegun
Hear it echo in the night
Mortals firing rains the scene
Scars the fields
that once were green

It's a stalemate at the frontline
where the soldiers rest in mud
roads and houses
all is gone
there is no glory to be won

know that many men will suffer
know that many men will die
half a million lives at stake
Ask the fields of Passchendaele

And as the night falls the general calls
and the battle carries on and on
How long?
What is the purpose of it all
What's the price of a mile?

Thousands of feet march to the beat
It's an army on the march
Long way from home
Paying the price in young men's lives
Thousands of feet march to the beat
It's an army in despair
Knee-deep in mud
Stuck in the trench with no way out

Thousands of machineguns
Kept on firing through the night
Mortars blazed and wrecked the scene
Guns in the fields that once were green

Still a deadlock at the frontline
Where the soldiers die in mud
roads and houses since long gone
still no glory has been won
know that many men has suffered
know that many men has died

Six miles of ground has been won
Half a million men are gone
And as the men crawled the general called
And the killing carried on and on
How long?
What's the purpose of it all?
What's the price of a mile?

Thousands of feet march to the beat
It's an army on the march
Long way from home
Paying the price in young men's lives
Thousands of feet march to the beat
It's an army in despair
Knee-deep in mud
Stuck in the trench with no way out

Young men are dying
They pay the price
Oh how they suffer
So tell me what's the price of a mile

That's the price of a mile.

Thousands of feet march to the beat
It's an army on the march
Long way from home
Paying the price in young men's lives
Thousands of feet march to the beat
It's an army in despair
Knee-deep in mud
Stuck in the trench with no way out


12. Firestorm

But a kingdom that has once been destroyed can never come back into being nor can the dead ever be brought back to life

Warnings of an airstrike
The sirens scream out loud
Warning on the radio
Of what's coming
Appearing on the radar
A threat from overseas
Planes on the horizon
Cast shadows on the ground

Bringers of destruction
Are ravaging the land
Fury of the bombers
A force to reckon with
Sets the world on fire
Then turns to strike again
Flames are burning higher
The bombs keep falling

AA guns are blazing
As the sky is turning red
better run for cover
You'll be quick or be dead

Burn Burn
Rage of the heavens
Burn Burn
Death from above
Die Die
Merciless killing
Burn Burn
Death from above

Carpet bombing cities
And grinding them to dust
Able men and women
Will all be victims
Everyone will suffer
In the wake of their attack
Bombers show no mercy
A land in ruin
Homes are turned to rubble
When the airstrike has been approved
Facing their destruction
Fear the black wings of death

Burn Burn
Rage of the heavens
Burn Burn
Death from above
Die Die
Merciless killing
Burn Burn

Nothing remains
Cities ruined, turned to dust
All has been lost
Rise from the ashes and strike

AA guns are blazing
As the sky is turning red
Bend under a cover
You be quick or be dead

Burn Burn
Rage of the heavens
Burn Burn
Death from above
Die Die
Merciless killing
Burn Burn
Death from above


13. A Secret

"Hostile armies may face each other for years, striving for the victory which is decided in a single day."


14. Swedish Pagans

["The Art Of War Re-Armed" bonus track]

The wise woman said:
"Once you're hardened in battle
There's no coming back.
Fight or Fall!"

And before the attack
Feel your blood start to boil in your veins as you charge
Hundreds fallen

As the fire inside
Is ignited by bloodshed
In berserkers from north
Could it be as was said
When the serpent be woken
Fenrir howls

Swedish Pagans, marching ashore
Forged in Valhalla by the hammer of Thor
Out from Asgaard, a viking ship sails
Never to turn back again!

Where our brothers have fought
Is where we will be proven
On ground stained by blood
Standing tall!

And we know, if we fall
Our comrades awaits in Valhall
Odin's calling!

As the fire inside
Is ignited by bloodshed
In berserkers from north
Could it be as was said
When the serpent be woken
Fenrir howls

Swedish Pagans, marching ashore
Forged in Valhalla by the hammer of Thor
Out from Asgaard, a viking ship sails
Never to turn back again!

First to the battle
First to the feast
Destiny waiting,
No retreat,
Retreat!

Swedish Pagans, marching ashore
Forged in Valhalla by the hammer of Thor
Out from Asgaard, a viking ship sails
Never to turn back again!


15. Glorious Land

["The Art Of War Re-Armed" bonus track]

Endless waste,
Our patience runs thin.
Here we stand ready.
Let the battle begin!

Hit back! Charge!
As the forces arrive.
Shove! Go! Push!
In the foes let collide!

Facing the storm, battered and torn,
Fighting for our Glorious Land!
Come take our hand, together we stand
Defending our Glorious Land!

Darkness falls
And the screams fade away.
Home of the fallen
And the home of the brave!

Facing the storm, battered and torn,
Fighting for our Glorious Land!
Come take our hand, together we stand
Defending our Glorious Land!

Facing the storm, battered and torn,
Fighting for our Glorious Land!
Come take our hand, together we stand
Defending our Glorious Land!

Facing the storm, battered and torn,
Fighting for our Glorious Land!
Come take our hand, together we stand
Defending our Glorious Land!

1. Coat Of Arms

At dawn envoy arrives
Morning of October 28th
"No day" proven by deed
Descendants of Sparta,
Athens and Crete!

Look north, ready to fight
Enemies charge from the hills
To arms! Facing defeat!
There's no surrender! There's no retreat!

Time after time
Force their enemies back to the line
Call to arms banners fly in the wind
For the glory of Hellas
Coat of arms reading "Freedom or death!"
Blood of king Leonidas

Air raid pounding the land
Bombers are flying both day and night
Endure six days of rain
Dropped by invaders bomb raid in vain

Strike hard, the tables have turned
Drive them back over the hills
At arms! Just like before
Soldiers, civilians, Hellas at war

By their own hand
Forced the enemy out of their land

Call to arms, banners fly in the wind
For the glory of Hellas
Coat of arms reading "Freedom or death!"
Blood of king Leonidas

Just like their ancestors ages ago
Fought in the face of defeat
Those three hundred men
Left a pride to uphold
Freedom of death in effect

Then, now again
Blood of heroes saving their land

Call to arms, banners fly in the wind
For the glory of Hellas
Coat of arms reading "Freedom or death!"
Blood of king Leonidas

Call to arms, banners fly in the wind
For the glory of Hellas
Coat of arms reading "Freedom or death!"
Blood of king Leonidas


2. Midway

Send them over the waves
Our sentinels
They report in the news
Position of our foes

This battlefield's been chosen, tactically in advance
Time to alert our fighters
We're soon in range

Midway
We'll meet at Midway
Naval War

Calling all men to deck
Got to be airborne
Head out into the sun
Decending on our foes

This is the crucial moment, in the heat of the war
To fly and hit our targets
Down in the waves

Midway
Display their might, ordering carriers, admirals at war
We'll meet at Midway
To win the fight, tactics are crucial, naval war

Far from shore, a pacific war
bombs are falling from the skies
Its a bombrun day, it the naval way
A bloodred sun is on the rise


3. Uprising

Warsaw Rise!

Do you remember when, when the Nazis forced their rule on Poland 1939 and the allies turned away
From the underground rose a hope of freedom as a whisper
City in despair, but they never lost their faith

Women, men and children fight
they were dying side by side
And the blood they shed upon the streets
was a sacrifice willingly paid

Warsaw city at war
Voices from underground

whispers of freedom
1944 help that never came
Calling Warsaw city at war
Voices from underground

whispers of freedom
Rise up and hear the call
History calling to you
'Warszawo, walcz!'

Spirit soul and heart
in accordance with the old traditions
1944 still the allies turn away
Fighting street to street
in a time of hope and desperation
Did it on their own and they never lost their faith

Women, men and children fight
they were dying side by side
And the blood they shed upon the streets
was a sacrifice willingly paid

Warsaw city at war
Voices from underground

whispers of freedom
1944 help that never came
Calling Warsaw city at war
Voices from underground

whispers of freedom
Rise up and hear the call
History calling to you
'Warszawo, walcz!'

[Solo – Oskar & Rikard]

[2x]
All the streetlights in the city
broken many years ago
Break the curfew, hide in sewers
Warsaw it's time to rise now

Warsaw city at war
Voices from underground

whispers of freedom
1944 help that never came
Calling Warsaw city at war
Voices from underground

whispers of freedom
Rise up and hear the call
History calling to you
'Warszawa, walcz!'


4. Screaming Eagles

Crack of the lightning splitting the ground
Thunder is sounding, artillery pounding
Wrath of the Nazi's cast on Bastogne
Facing their forces alone

ALONE! [2x]

Sent from the skies jumped into the unknown
The march to Berlin has begun
Spearhead the charge surrounded by foes
Eagles are leading the way

France is still under enemy rule
Push, axis retreat

Thrown towards Arnhem a bitter defeat
They're stretched out just one bridge too far
Turn of the tide, it's breaking away
Losing momentum, retreat

Go to Bastogne, the crossroads must hold
Stand, alone in the cold

Crack of the lightning splitting the ground
Thunder is sounding, artillery pounding
Wrath of the Nazi's cast on Bastogne
Facing their forces alone

ALONE! [2x]

Dig your own foxholes or dig your own Grave
The storm is about to begin
The siege has begun, there's nowhere to run
Panzerkampfwagen emerge

Tanks and mortars are shaking the ground
Prey of man and machine

Crack of the lightning splitting the ground
Thunder is sounding, artillery pounding
Wrath of the Nazi's cast on Bastogne
Facing their forces alone

Chill of the winter bite to the bone and Christmas is drawing near
Soldiers are freezing, the death toll increasing
They're dying in their holes
There's no surrender there's no retreat, the Wehrmacht is drawing near
There's no reinforcements they're fighting all alone

Sent from the skies ended up in Bastogne
As easy, as hard as they get
Nazi command request and demand
Offer surrender – declined

Nuts! The generals word echo clear
Nuts! The Nazi's shall hear

[2x]
Crack of the lightning splitting the ground
Thunder is sounding, artillery pounding
Wrath of the Nazi's cast on Bastogne
Facing their forces alone


5. The Final Solution

Country in depression
Nation in despair
One man seeking reasons everywhere
Growing hate and anger
The Fuhrer's orders were precise
Who was to be blamed and pay the price!

Wicked propaganda
Turning neighbors into foes
Soldiers of the third Reich searching homes
And then the former friends are watching
As they are rounded up one by one
Times of prosecutions has begun

Ever since it started
On Crystal night of 38
When liberty died
And truth was denied
Sent away on train on a one way trip to hell
Enter the gates Auschwitz awaits!

When freedom burns
The final solution
Dreams fade away and all hope turns to dust
When millions burn
The curtain has fallen
Lost to the world as they perish in flames

There was a country in depression
There was a nation in despair
One man finding reasons everywhere
Then there was raising hate and anger
The Fuhrer's orders still apply
Who was to be blamed and send to die!

[1x chorus]
[2x chorus]


6. Aces In Exile

In the skies above the isle
Aces In Exile prevail!

From near and far they arrived join the force
Ready to serve the Allied command
Sent in the training, though they already earned their wings
They were ready to fly they were fit for the fight
Once in the air the battle began
They had proven their worth now they fight for revenge

Fighter pilots in exile fly for foreign land
Let the story be heard tell of 303
Fighter pilots of Poland in the battle of Britain
Guarding the skies of the isle

Even at night shadows cover the ground
Fighting goes on from dusk till dawn
We fall on the Reich with the claws of the eagle!
They were Ready to fight, they were ready to die
Up in the air, the battle goes on
They had proven their worth now they have their revenge

Fighter pilots in exile fly for foreign land
Tell the story again to the 310
Men of Czechoslovakia in the battle of Britain
Guarding the skies of the isle

Over the battlefield brave man long way from home
You are the chosen ones sent to the sky to die
Over the battlefield brave man long way from home
You are the chosen ones sent to the sky to die

Oh fly - it echoes in history
Turning the tides in the heavens above

Fighter pilots in exile fly for foreign land
When the battle's been won trouble 401
Fighter pilots of Canada in the battle of Britain
Guarding the skies of the isle

On wings of history they turn from home
To live eternally sky bound they roam
In all of history, never before
Was more owed to so few

Fighter pilot in exile!


7. Saboteurs

Dropped down to a world of ice
A platoe of frozen lakes
A Nazi place of doom in their sights
Training camps on Scottish Heights
To commando saboteurs
A mission of their lives lies ahead

[Chorus:]
Called in to serve
And they knew what to do
They were the heroes of the cold

Warrior soul, they signed a book of history
They played a leading role to win the 2nd war

Allied time was running short
They would race against the bomb
And hours turned to days, time passed on
As the nature Test their strength
They would fight through night and day
To live amongst the wild, stay alive

Called in to serve
And they knew what to do
They were the heroes of the cold

Warrior soul, they signed a book of history
They played a leading role to win the 2nd war

Heroes of the telemark
Carry viking blood in veins
Warriors of the northern land
They live forever more [x2]

Called in to serve
And they knew what to do
They were the heroes of the cold

Warrior soul!

Warrior soul, they signed a book of history
They played a leading role to win the 2nd war [x2]


8. Wehrmacht

Pulled into war to serve a vision
That's supposed to last a thousand years
Part of a machine unstoppable
As merciless as tidal waves

Were they the victims of the time
Or proud parts of lager goals?
Propaganda of the Reich masterful machine

Time and again the battle rages on
Beyond the gates of misery
As casualties rise and millions die around them
Did they see it all?

Crazy mademen on a leash
Or young men who lost their way?
Grand illusions of the Reich
May seem real at times

Panzers on a line
Form the Wehrmacht's spine
Lethal grand design
What about the men executing orders?

Ad victoriam
Ex machina
Non sibi sed patriae [x2]

Pulled into war to serve a vision
That just didn't last a thousand years
Part of a machine
Though stoppable as merciless as tidal waves

Crazy mademen on a leash
Or young men who lost their way?
Grand illusions of the Reich
May seem real at times

Panzers on a line
Form the Wehrmacht's spine
Lethal grand design
What about the men executing orders?


9. White Death

Almost night, a crimson horizon
Painting thousand lakes red
As your army approach in the east
A hunter is switching his prey

All alone, a man with his gun
Wanders into the wild
Track you down, you can't hide
Once he's on to your trail

Into the night, a flash in the darkness
White Death is heading your way
The fear of his foes, a hero at home
Hundreds will fall by his gun

You're in the snipers sight
the first kill tonight
Time to die
You're in the bullets way
The White Death's prey
Say goodbye!

After the dawn, when morning is broken
Snow once white turn to red
Hundred soldiers, we have them on sight
A tale of a sniper is born

Snow in mouth, hiding his breath
He is steady at hand
Eye to eye, target in sight!
The moment to fire has come

Hundreds of kills, a man and his rifle
Embodied the Sisu of Finn's
Stay out of sight and cover your head
When he pulls the trigger you're dead!

You're in the snipers sight
the first kill tonight
Time to die
You're in the bullets way
The White Death's prey
Say goodbye!

[Solo]

You're in the snipers sight
the first kill tonight
Time to die
You're in the bullets way
The White Death's prey
Say goodbye!

(You're in the snipers sight)
SNIPERS SIGHT!
(You're his first kill tonight)
FIRST KILL TONIGHT!
(Say goodbye, say goodbye)
SAY GOODBYE!
(You will fall by his gun)

(You're in the snipers sight)
SNIPERS SIGHT!
(You're his first kill tonight)
FIRST KILL TONIGHT!
(Say goodbye, say goodbye)
SAY GOODBYE!
(White death is coming for you)


10. Metal Ripper

You're in for surprise, you're in for a shock
In London town streets when there's darkness and fog
I'm going down, all the way down
I'm on the highway to hell from here

Blessed by the night, holy and bright
Called by the toll of the bell
Oh Mr. Crowley did you talk to the dead
Sleep with the devil and then you must pay

Abandoned land come on in child take my hand
Hear a rising force
Watch the devils, the damned they're gonna break their chains
Through the night you can hear them

Twisting you mind and smashing your dreams
Blinded by me you can't see a thing
Torches blazed and sacred chants were praised
Blood on your face you big disgrace

A strand of silver hanging through the sky
Touching more than you can see
Appears like a wonder without any move
Gonna get close, closer to you

Abandoned land come on in child take my hand
Hear a rising force
Watch the devils, the damned they're gonna break their chains
Through the night

All aboard, hahahahaha

Abandoned land come on in child take my hand
Hear a rising force
Watch the devils, the damned they're gonna break their chains
Through the night...

Abandoned land come on in child take my hand
Hear a rising force
Watch the devils, the damned they're gonna break their chains
Through the night you can hear them

1. Dominium Maris Baltici

2. Lejonet Från Norden
The Lion From The North

A time of religion and war,
Legends tell the tale of a lion
This beast in the shape of a man,
With a dream to rule sea and land

And all those who stand in his way,
Will die, by God and victorious arms
With the righteous that follows him south,
Once more, set ashore, to war

Legends have taught, battles fought,
This lion has no fear at heart
Lion come forth, come from the north,
Come from the no-o-o-o-ort

Gustavus! Adolphus!
(Gustavus Adolphus go forth, libera, impera)
Libera et impera!
Acerbus et ingens!
(Acerbus et ingens leo, libera, impera)
Augusta per augusta

A storm over Europe unleashed,
Dawn of war, a trail of destruction
The power of Rome won't prevail,
See the catholics shiver and shake

The future of warfare unveiled,
Showed the way, that we still walk today
Der Löwe aus Mitternacht comes,
Once more, he is here, for war

Stories of old, truth unfold,
Control over Europe he holds
Freedom he'll bring,
Lion and king, lion and king

Mighty eagle rule alone
Liberator claim the throne
Lion from the northern land
Take the scepter, from its hand
Oh, oh, oh you lion from the north,
Ooooooooh you lion from the north

. Gott Mit Uns

God With Us

Spent the night in formation,
To the battle we marched in the dawn...
We were ready to die for our king
On the fields of Breitenfeld

Fire at will
Aim for their cannons
Counter attack
Thunder of guns

Gott mit uns
As we all stand united
All together Gott mit uns

From the old world's demise
See an empire rise
From the north reaching far
Here we are

On September the seventh
We filled their hearts with fear
Seven times they attacked on that day
Seven times they retreated

Cavalry charge
Follow that banner
After the king
Freedom we bring

Breaking their lines
Thousands of soldiers
Run for their lives
Legends arise


En Livstid I Krig
A Lifetime Of War

Two ways to view the world so similar at times
Two ways to rule the world to justify their crimes
By kings and queens young men are sent to die in war
Their propaganda speaks those words been heard before

Two ways to view the world brought Europe down in flames
Two ways to rule

Has man gone insane?
A few will remain
Who'll find a way
To live one more day
Through decades of war.
It spreads like disease,
There's no sign of peace.
Religion and creed
Cause millions to bleed.
Three decades of war.

From dawn to dawn they're fighting,
Die where they stand
The fog of war lies thick
When armies scorch the land.
When all of Europe's burning
What can be done?
They've been to war a decade,
Two more to come

Long way from home
Döpas och dö I strid
Lifetime at war

Has man gone insane?
A few will remain
Who'll find a way
To live one more day
Through decades of war.
It spreads like disease,
There's no sign of peace.
Religion and creed
Cause millions to bleed.
Three decades of war.

When they face death they're all alike
No right or wrong, rich or poor
No matter who they served before
Good or bad, they're all the same
Rest side by side now

Has man gone insane?
A few will remain
Who'll find a way
To live one more day
Through decades of war.
It spreads like disease,
There's no sign of peace.
Religion and creed
Cause millions to bleed.
Three decades of war.

Has man gone insane?
A few will remain
Who'll find a way
To live one more day
Through decades of war.
It spreads like disease,
There's no sign of peace.
Religion and creed
Cause millions to bleed.
Three decades of war.

1648

While Europe speak of peace, all other battles cease
There's a man who aims for more than he can reach
Blood,
All over
Prague
On fire
Burn
All of Bohemia set ablaze
Stand on their own

The road to the city has been blocked
Denied
(They're denied)
To enter the gates
Though they tried
(Though they tried)
When Prague was called to arms
They fought them on the bridge
Their freedom was at stake

Stand and fight, the city is burning
Königsmarck lost, stopped him at Karluv Most.
Stained by blood, their brothers die side by side
Did what they could
Died where they stood

Their city has been besieged, all hell on Prague unleashed
As the cannons crush the walls, the city shakes
Fear
Is spreading
Hate
Increasing
Death
And pain is all that Sweden brought
Rise and strike back

The walls of the city has been breached
Reclaimed
(They're reclaimed)
On that very night
Unsustained
(Unsustained)
They did it on their own
They fought them on the bridge
Their freedom was at stake

Unconquered city on Vltavas shore
Start of the conflict and end of the war
Unconquered city on Vltavas shore
Is protected by its people
And thirty years ago the war begun
It has returned to where it started

Karolinens Bön

The Caroleans Prayer

Far beyond their nations' borders
There's an army on the march
For religion, kng and glory
In the name of Christ their enemies chastise

Taking orders from the heavens
Through hostile fire they will march
Unaffected by the volleys
Facing death their faith will keep their fear at bay

Into battle facing the fire, Lord thy will be done
Into battle walk in a line

See the white in their eyes, Caroleans are marching on
Put their lives in God's hand for their kingdom and fatherland
See the white in their eyes, Caroleans are marching on

Morale and discipline unites them
A common faith to keep them strong
Always on their way to heaven
In the name of Christ their enemies chastise

Our Father, who art in heaven
Hallowed be thy name
Thy kingdom come
Thy will be done,
As it is in heaven on earth
Give us today our daily bread
And forgive us our debts

Ahead, facing the lead
An army of Swedes, performing God's deeds
Showing no fear, their judgement is near
Making their sacrifice
When the king and his men
Their enemies sight, prepare for the fight
Banners held high, ready to die
Hear how they praise the Lord

Carolus Rex

All embrace me
It's my time to rule at last
Fifteen years have I been waiting
To sit upon my throne

No allegiance
I will swear no oath
Crowned by god not by the church
As my power is divine

They thought I was too young to rule the land
Just as they failed to understand
Born to rule
My time has come

I was chosen by heaven
Say my name when you pray
To the skies
See carolus rise
With the lord my protector
Make them bow to my will
To the skies
See carolus rise

To the skies
See carolus rise

Proved in battle
Led my men to victory
No man alive or dead commands me
I answer to the lord

Hear my orders
Question me and die
What I say was said in heaven
And so it shall be done

I know I was destined to rule alone
All for myself I have claimed the throne
Born to rule
My time is now

I was chosen by heaven
Say my name when you pray
To the skies
See carolus rise
With the lord my protector
Make them bow to my will
To the skies
See carolus rise

To the skies
See carolus rise

[Spoken words by Joakim Brodén:]
Framåt Karoliner
Fiendens dom är här
Låt oss krossa dom
Kasta in dom genom helvetets portar

All that's thine
Shall be mine
There's no stopping me
All over Europe my rule shall be questioned by none

All I see
Give to me,
That is my decree
My will be done

They thought I was too young to rule the land
Just as they failed to understand
Born to rule
My time is now

I was chosen by heaven
Say my name when you pray
To the skies
See carolus rise
To the skies

With the lord my protector
Make them bow to my will
To the skies
See carolus rise
To the skies
See carolus rise


Ett Slag Färgat Rött

Killing Ground

At Fraustadt the Swedish forces faced
An army almost twice its size.
And on that day we showed the world not only
Our superiority in battle but also
How cruel man can be.

Frozen ground,
Ride with the wind
Emerge from the gunsmoke like demons
Rehnskiöld's men
Charging their flanks
The enemy trembles with fear

One by one the Saxons disband
Or die where they stand

Killing ground
Even though you surrender
Turn around
You will never survive
Killing ground
At the battle of Fraustadt

Fall in line
Battle formations
Show no fear
Riding them down
Break their will
Show them no mercy
Caroleans attack

Round them up, look into their eyes
They beg for their lives

See the Caroleans standing tall
All for one and one for all
Enemies fall at their feet
Begging for their mercy
See the Caroleans standing tall
Conquer lands and slaughter all
Enemies fall at their feet
Victory and great defeat

Poltava

Time has worn the soldiers down
Marched for many miles
In the eastern lands so cursed
Time to make a stand

Tsar has scorched his nation's land
Nothing to be found
Hunger grasp the soldiers heart
20 000 men strong

Listen, excuse for a king
Trust me, this fight you can't win

Poltava
Rode to certain death and pain
Poltava
Swedish soldiers met their bane
Poltava
Sacrificed their lives in vain
Poltava

In the shade of morning mist
Advancing on their foe
Bullets break the silent air
Wasted battle plan

Swedish forces stand alone
King has left command
Rule is left to lesser men
Waiting for their chance

Listen, obey my command
Hear me, or die by my hand

Russian armies blocked their way
20 000 lost that day
They bled the ground
Peace they found
There's no sign of victory
King Carolus had to flee
And leave the land
Leave command

Madness, curse your feeble horde
Fear me, you'll die by my sword

Konungens Likfärd

Long Live The King

Dreams are seldom shattered, by a bullet in the dark
Rulers come and rulers go, will our kingdom fall apart?

Who shall we now turn to, when our leaders lost their heart?
Lives are lost but at what cost, will the grand dream fall apart?

Killed by his own or by his foes, turned the tide
300 years still no one knows, the secret remains

Broken dreams so grand, sing of his final stand, long live Carolus
Brought by soldiers hand, back to the fatherland, long live Carolus Rex

Brought him back to Sweden, where we put him in a chest
Years of war and agony, now the king can finally rest

What will be uncovered, from that cold November night
Fredrikshald, what happened there, will it ever come to light?

For their honor
For their glory
For the men who fought and bled
A soldier from Sweden remembers the dead


1. Night Witches

From the depths of Hell in silence
Cast their spells, explosive violence
Russian night time flight perfected
Flawless vision, undetected

Pushing on and on, their planes are going strong
Air force's number one
Somewhere down below they're looking for the foe
Bomber's on a run
You can't hide, you can't move, just abide
Their attack's been proved
Raiders in the dark
Silent through the night the witches join the fight
Never miss their mark

Canvas wings of death
Prepare to meet your fate
Night bomber regiment
588

Undetected, unexpected
Wings of glory
Tell their story
Avidiation, deviation
Undetected
Stealth perfected

Foes are losing ground, retreating to the sound
Death is int he air
Suddenly appears, confirming all your fears
Strike from witches lair
Target found, come around, barrels sound
From the battleground
Axis aiming high
Rodina awaits, defeat them at the gates
Live to fight and fly

Beneath the starlight of the heavens
Unlikely heroes in the skies
Witches to attack, witches coming back
As they appear on the horizon
The wind will whisper when the Night Witches come


2. No Bullets Fly

From down below one enemy’s spotted
So hurry up, rearm and refuel
But through the bomber's damaged air frame
See wounded men scattered and burned

Look to the right and then look again
And see the enemy in the eye
No bullets fly, spared by his mercy
Escorted out, out of harm’s way

Fly, fighting fair
It’s the code of the air
Brothers, heroes, foes

Killing machine
Thunder in the sky
B-17
Flying home
Killing machine
Said goodbye to the Cross he deserved

He risked his life 2 times that day
To save an unknown enemy
Escort to safety, out of the killzone
A short salute, then departed

Fly, fighting fair
It's the code of the air
Brothers, heroes, foes

Killing machine
Thunder in the sky
B-17
Flying home
Killing machine
Said goodbye to the Cross he deserved

Ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
Ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
Ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
Ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhh

Fly, fighting fair
It's the code of the air
Brothers, heroes, foes

Killing machine
Thunder in the sky
B-17
Flying home
Killing machine
Said goodbye to the Cross he deserved


3. Smoking Snakes

We remember, no surrender
Heroes of our century

3 men stood strong, and they held out for long
Going into the fight, to their death that awaits
Crazy or brave, will it end in the grave?
As they're giving their lives
As their honor dictates

Far, far from home, to a war
Fought on foreign soil and
Far, far from known, tell their tale,
Their forgotten story
Cobras fumantes, eterna é sua vitória

Rise from the blood of your heroes
You, were the ones who refused to surrender
The 3, rather died than to flee,
Know that your memory,
Will be sung for a century

3 took the blow, while impressing their foe
Throwing dice, with their lives
As they're paying the price
Sent to raise hell, hear the toll of the bell
It is calling for you as the Wehrmacht devised

Sent over seas to be cast into fire
Fought for a purpose with pride and desire
Blood of the brave they would give to inspire
Cobras fumantes, your memory lives!


4. Inmate 4859

The dawn of century a boy born by a lake
Resettled from Karelia’s plains
Go to a man in exile as the Great War came
Unleashed a shadow on his world

Witold, Witold, who knows his name?

Inmate in hell or a hero in prison?
Soldier in Auschwitz who knows his name
Locked in a cell, waging war from the prison
Hiding in Auschwitz who hides behind 4859

Outside of never came decided to break free
The end of April ‘43
Joined the Uprising, fight on the streets while hiding his rank
Takes command (all for) serving his country in need

Witold, Witold, who knows his name?

Inmate in hell or a hero in prison?
Soldier in Auschwitz who knows his name
Locked in a cell, waging war from the prison
Hiding in Auschwitz who hides behind 4859

Sent to the prison where the heroes are judged as traitors
Accused of treason by his own
Sentenced by countrymen under pressure of foreign influence
Men he once fought to free

Inmate in hell or a hero in prison?
Soldier in Auschwitz we know his name
Locked in a cell, waging war from the prison
Hiding in Auschwitz he hides behind 4859


5. To Hell And Back

A short man from Texas
A man of the wild
Thrown into combat
Where bodies lie piled

Hides his emotions
His blood's running cold
Just like his victories
his story unfolds

Bright
A white light
If there'd be
any glory in war

Let it rest
On men like him

Dead men will never come back

Crosses grow on Anzio
Where no soldiers sleep
and where hell is six feet deep
That death does wait
There's no debate
So charge and attack
going to Hell and Back

A man of the 15th
A man of "Can Do"
Friends fall around him
And yet he came through

Let them fall face down
If they must die
Making it easier
To say goodbye

Bright
A white light
If there'd be
any glory in war

Let it rest
On men like him

Who went to Hell and came back

Crosses grow on Anzio
Where no soldiers sleep
and where hell is six feet deep
That death does wait
There's no debate
So charge and attack
going to Hell and Back

Oh gather round me
And listen while I speak
Of a war
Where Hell is six feet deep

And all along the shore
Where cannons still roar
They're haunting my dreams
They're still there when I sleep

Crosses grow on Anzio
Where no soldiers sleep
and where hell is six feet deep
That death does wait
There's no debate
He charged and attacked
He went to hell and back


6. The Ballad Of Bull

Sometimes war is killing
Sometimes it's saving lives
It's the judgement of faith
It's nothing that men can dictate

Corporal Leslie Allen carried them from Tambu
Saved his brothers in arms
Went out and followed through

There and back again
Bull just carried on
Under fire he carried them out one by one
There and back again
Bullets all around
Out of the men that he carried away
Twelve men would now live to see one more day
His fear held at bay
As he carried them away

Sometimes war is killing
Sometimes it's saving lives
From Australia shore
Bull Allen went to war

Sometimes war is saving
Sometimes it's taking lives
Thanks to one single man
A dozen more survives

There and back again
Bull just carried on
Under fire he carried them out one by one
There and back again
Bullets all around
Out of the men that he carried away
Twelve men would now live to see one more day
His fear held at bay
As he carried them away

Some men return from a war in a bag
And yet the world knows the story
Others return unwilling to plan a life
When humble at heart

No

There and back again
Bull just carried on
Under fire he carried them out one by one
There and back again
Bullets all around
Out of the men that he carried away
Twelve men would now live to see one more day
His fear held at bay
As he carried them away


7. Resist And Bite

War is coming swiftly
The borders closing in
We're a company of soldiers
Mere 40 rifles strong

All alone
Stand alone

Ardenner ground is burning,
And Rommel is at hand
As the Blitzkrieg's pushing harder
The war is all around!

All around
Hold your ground!

Fight all 18 days of battles,
No odds are on our side
Few will fight for all until the bullets are gone

[Chorus:]
We!
We will resist and bite!
Bite hard
Cause we are all in sight
We!
We take up arms and fight!
Fight hard!
Resist and do what's right!

No matter our fighting
The numbers will still count
We're outgunned and few in numbers
We're doomed to flag of fail

We fought hard
Held our guard
But when captured by the Axis
And forced to tell the truth
We'll tell it with a smile,
We will surprise them with a laugh

We are all
We were all

We were told to hold the border
And that is what we did
Honored were our orders
In despite of our foe

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
Gloria fortis miles
The Wehrmacht closing in
Adversor et admorsus
The Boar against the Eagle
Gloria fortis miles
The Wehrmacht closing in
Adversor et admorsus
The Boar against the Eagle

[Chorus]


8. Soldier Of 3 Armies

Started out as a reserve
Soon promoted when deserved
And the legend has begun

With a bounty on his head
The red army wants him dead
Soviet enemy number one

Cross of Mannerheim
Addicted to the war game
Never-ending flame
Victory reclaimed

Oh we remember
We remember

Lauri Törni's name
A soldier of three armies knows the game
Keeps their echo from the past
Rise from beyond your grave
Son of Finland and the Green Beret

Across the water a new start
War still beating in his heart
A new legend has been born

Started out as a reserve
Soon promoted when deserved
Changed his name to

Cross of Mannerheim
Addicted to the war game
Never-ending flame
Victory reclaimed

Oh we remember
We remember

A soldier of three armies knows the game
Keeps their echo from the past
Rise from beyond your grave
Son of Finland and the Green Beret

Lauri Allan Törni


9. Far From The Fame

As the great war is over and lost
He's been wounded in war, he returns with awards
Into battle again far from home
From a far distant land, our Marshal command

Home
Siblings sent to their death
His wife paid the ultimate price
Still
As the war rages on
You are our guide

Far, far from the fame
Far, far away from the fame
But we still remember your name
Karel Janoušek!
We mourn the day that you died
So be our guide, Czechoslovakia's pride

When the war has been fought and been won
Our Marshal returns, to be thrown into jail
Facing torture and years behind bars
When he's finally back, life in ivory black

Home
Siblings sent to their death
His wife paid the ultimate price
Still
As the war rages on
You are our guide

Far, far from the fame
Far, far away from the fame
But we still remember your name
Karel Janoušek!
We mourn the day that you died
So be our guide, Czechoslovakia's pride

Far, far from the fame
Far, far away from the fame
But we still remember your name
Karel Janoušek!
We mourn the day that you died
So be our guide, Czechoslovakia's pride

Far, far from the fame
Far, far away from the fame
But we still remember your name
Karel Janoušek!
We mourn the day that you died
So be our guide, Czechoslovakia's pride


10. Hearts Of Iron

See the Reich in flames
Try to save Berlin in vain
It's a road through death and pain
On the other shore, there's the end of the war

Who could ever have believed,
Seems like nothing's been achieved
Just to walk a day, go all the way
The fronts are closing in
As the end is drawing near,
The 12th Army interfere
Open up a route, get people out,
It's forces spread out thin

It's the end of the war
(Hold the corridor!)
Reach for Elbe's shore!

It's the end, the war has been lost
Keeping them safe 'til the river's been crossed
Nicht ein Schlacht, ein Rettungsaktion
Holding their ground 'til the final platoon
"Hurry up, we're waiting for you"
Men of the 9th and civilians too!
Dispossessed, surrendering to the West

Who'll survive and who will die?
Up to Kriegsglück to decide
Those who made it cross without a loss
Have reason to reflect
It is not about Berlin, it is not about the Reich
It's about the men, who fought for them,
What peace can they expect?

See the city burn on the other side
Going down in flames as two worlds collide
Who can now look back with a sense of pride?
On the other shore, there's the end of the war...


12. Man Of War

[Bonus Track]

Masters of the wind
Metal warriors number one
Sleipnir met the king of kings
Where all men play on ten
It's wrath of Thor
They are men at war
The sign of the hammers, our guide

It's a metal daze
As the outlaw's ways
Return from the warlord at last

Blood of the kings defender
King of the "gods of war"

With the heart of steel
And hell on wheels
The kings of metal lead us
It's the king of kings the crown and ring
Carry on, as our kingdom come

It's a call to arms
Our battle hymns
Today is good day to die
Sons of Odin call
In Valhalla’s hall
Let the blood of enemies flow

Blood of the kings, defender
King of the gods of war

With the heart of steel
And hell on wheels
The kings of metal lead us
It's the king of kings the crown and ring
Carry on, as our kingdom come

Blood of the kings defender
King of the gods of war

With the heart of steel
And hell on wheels
The kings of metal lead us
It's the king of kings the crown and ring
Carry on, as our kingdom come

1. Sparta

Many many years ago, when Persia came ashore
Heeding Leonidas' call the Spartans went to war

Joined by their brothers, a few against the fateful horde
Hellenic hearts are set aflame, the hot gates calls their name

A final stand, stop the Persians, spear in hand
Form a wall, live to fall, and live forever

Sparta! Hellas!
Then, and again. Sing of three hundred men
Slaughter! Persians!
Glory and death. Spartans will never surrender

Morning has broken, today they're fighting in the shade

When arrows blocked the sun they fell,
Tonight they dine in Hell

By traitor's hand. secret passage, to their land
Know his name, know his shame will last forever


2. Last Dying Breath

War begun, the Kaiser has come
Day or night, the shells keep falling
Overrun but never outdone
Street to street, denying defeat

Soldiers of the Serbian army
Keep your heads held high
Overrun, you fall one by one
For Belgrade and the fatherland

Soldiers, heroes, die for your land
Your lives are gone, erased by your command

Until your last dying breath

Overrun, you're under the gun
Day or night, the shells kept falling
Sound the drum, the great war has come
Show no fear, the ending is near

A final charge, to face the fire
Falling one by one
Major calls. The white city falls
Belgrade's streets are stained by blood

In haste, our lives are erased
Forward to glory for king and country

Defend the honour of Belgrade
Forward to glory, to face your fate at last


3. Blood Of Bannockburn

Now that our time has come to fight
Scotland must unite
We'll make a stand on Stirling ground
To put a challenge to the crown
We are one, we have come
We're here to break and end the occupation
We have our nation's fate in hand
It's time we make our final stand
Rally all the clans
Englishmen advance
Blood of Bannockburn
Point of no return
Join the Scottish revolution
Freedom must be won by blood
Now we call for revolution
Play the pipes and cry out loud
We need a king to rule our land
Bruce is in command
It is the crown that's in his sight
And it's the reason we will fight
To attack, send them back
And then we'll see to Bruce's coronation
We are the Scots with pikes in hand
And we will die to claim our land
Rallied all the clans
Halted English plans
Charge of Bannockburn
Freedom we shall earn
Join the Scottish revolution
Freedom must be won by blood
Now we call for revolution
Play the pipes and cry out loud
And as the hammer lost it's crown
And a weak heir to succeed it
Play the tunes of victory
Play them higher and higher tonight
Wallace showed the way
Led us to this day
Here at Bannockburn
Freedom we have earned
Join the Scottish revolution
Freedom must be won by blood
Now we call for revolution
Play the pipes and cry out loud
Join the Scottish revolution
Freedom must be won by blood
Now we call for revolution
Play the pipes and cry out loud


4. Diary Of An Unknown Soldier

I remember the Argonne, 1918.
The sounds of that battle still haunt me to this day.
Machine gun fire from enemy lines.
The sickening sound of a bayonet tearing through human flesh.
The soldier next to me firing his sidearm in desperation.
All these sounds still echo in my mind,
And as conducted by Death himself it all comes together as music.
A rhythm of death
A symphony of war


5. The Lost Battalion

Far from their land as they made their stand
They stood strong and the legend still lives on

1918
The great war rages on
A battalion is lost in the Argonne
Under fire there is nothing they can do
There's no way they can get a message through

Suffer heavy losses as the battle carries on
Liberty division standing strong

Far from their land as they made their stand
A disregarded demand
It's surrender or die and the stakes are high
They live or they die there's no time for goodbye

Weapon in hand as they made their stand
Still disregarding demand
They would never comply they would rather die
Broke through the blockade they were finally saved

Friendly fire, munitions running low
The supplies they were dropped upon their foe

1918
The war still rages on
The battlalion still trapped in the Argonne

Chose not to surrender
They chose victory or defeat
Fallen brothers resting by their feet

Far from their land as they made their stand
A disregarded demand
It's surrender or die and the stakes are high
They live and they die there's no time for goodbye

Weapon in hand as they made their stand
Still disregarding demand
They would never comply they would rather die
Broke through the blockade they were finally saved

Far from their land as they made their stand
A disregarded demand
It's surrender or die and the stakes are high
Live or die who can tell there's no goodbye

With a weapon in hand as they made their stand
Still disregarding demand
They would never comply they would rather die
They stood strong and the legend still lives on

Suffered heavy losses
Through the great war they stood strong
But the memory of the fallen still lives on

Far from their land as they made their stand
A disregarded demand
It's surrender or die and the stakes are high
They live and they die there's no time for goodbye

Weapon in hand as they made their stand
Still disregarding demand
They would never comply they would rather die
Broke through the blockade they were finally saved


6. Rorke's Drift

News that came that morning told that the main force had been slain
Chance for peace and justice gone and all talks had been in vain
A prince had been offended and he has gone the path of war
Now that 1500 men are dead and the Zulu's at the door

Zulus attack,
Fight back to back
Show them no mercy and
Fire at will
Kill or be killed
Facing, awaiting

A hostile spear, a new frontier. the end is near
There's no surrender
The lines must hold. Their story told, Rorke's drift controlled

Later on that fateful day as they head towards the drift
Stacking boxes, fortify, preparations must be swift
Spears and shields of oxen hide facing uniforms and guns
As the rifles fire, echoes higher, (beating) like the sound of drums

1879, when a few held the line
Back to back, attack, the dead are stacked
Where a last stand was made, and the empire saved
Back to back, attack, the dead are stacked


7. The Last Stand

In the heart of the holy see
In the home of Christianity
The seat of power is in danger

There's a foe of a thousand swords
They've been abandoned by their lords
Their fall from grace will pave their path, to damnation

Then the 189
In the service of heaven
They're protecting the holy line
It was 1527. Gave their lives on the steps to heaven
Thy will be done!

For the grace, for the might of our lord
For the home of the holy
For the faith, for the way of the sword
Gave their lives so boldly

For the grace, for the might of our lord
In the name of his glory
For the faith, for the way of the sword
Come and tell their story again

Under guard of 42
Along a secret avenue
Castel saint angelo is waiting

They're the guard of the holy see
They're the guards of Christianity
Their path to history is paved with salvation

Dying for salvation with dedication
No capitulation, annihilation
Papal commendation, reincarnation
Heaven is your destination
In the name of god

Gave their lives so boldly
Come and tell the Swiss Guards' story again


8. Hill 3234

Landed on the hilltop, soviet forces are in place
Awaiting orders!

They were only 39
They were told to hold the line
In control

Sent into battle, came from the sky
Trapped on a mountain, and into the fire

Hold your ground
When you're fighting those who fight
Death is waiting on the hill
No surrender, shoot to kill
You have to
Hold your ground
Kill the warrior in your sight
Death is waiting on the hill
No surrender, shoot to kill

January 7th, hold the hilltop at all costs
Follow orders!

Holding their ground
To the final round
One by one

Fight through the sundown, into the night
Enduring the darkness, awaiting the light

Stand, hold your ground
Come around
Hostile land
Your last stand

Under fire low on munitions,
Make your bullets count
Push their warriors back down the mountain,
Rule the battlefront


9. Shiroyama

It's the nature of time
That the old ways must give in
It's the nature of time
That the new ways comes in sin
When the new meets the old
It always ends the ancient ways
And as history told
The old ways go out in a blaze

Encircled by a vulture
The end of ancient culture
The dawn of destiny draws near

Imperial force defied
Facing 500 samurai
Surrounded and outnumbered
60 to 1 the sword face the gun
Bushido dignified
It's the last stand of the samurai
Surrounded and outnumbered

As a new age begins
The way of the warrior comes to an end
As a new age begins
The ways of the old must apprehend
It's the nature of time
That the old ways must give in
It's the nature of time
That the new ways comes in sin

An offer of surrender
Saigo ignore contender
The dawn of destiny is here

Imperial force defied
Facing 500 samurai
Surrounded and outnumbered
60 to 1 the sword face the gun
Bushido dignified
It's the last stand of the samurai
Surrounded and outnumbered

Until the dawn they hold on
Only 40 are left at the end
None alive, none survive
Shiroyama

Imperial force defied
Facing 500 samurai
Surrounded and outnumbered
60 to 1 the sword face the gun
Bushido dignified
It's the last stand of the samurai
Surrounded and outnumbered
60 to 1, facing the gun
60 to 1, culture undone


10. Winged Hussars

When the winged hussars arrive

A cry for help in time of need, await relief from holy league
60 days of siege, outnumbered and weak
Sent a message to the sky, wounded soldiers left to die
Will they hold the wall or will the city fall

Dedication
Dedication
They're outnumbered 15 to one
And the battle's begun

Then the winged hussars arrive
Coming down the mountainside
Then the winged hussars arrive
Coming down they turn the tide

As the days are passing by and as the dead are piling high
No escape and no salvation
Trenches to explosive halls are buried deep beneath the walls
Plant the charges there and watch the city fear

Desperation
Desperation
It's a desperate race against the mine
And a race against time

Cannonballs are coming down from the sky
Janissaries are you ready to die?
We will seek our vengeance eye for an eye

You'll be stopped upon the steps of our gate
On this field you're only facing our hate
But back home the sultan's sealing your fate

We remember
In September
That's the night Vienna was freed
We made the enemy bleed!

Storm clouds, fire and steel
Death from above make their enemy kneel

Fighting, power and grace
Death from above it's an army of wings

We remember, in September,
When the winged hussars arrive


11. The Last Battle

5th of May, V-Day is just around the corner
1945 the fuhrer reign is at its end

Jenny at the gates, as the SS open fire
There's no time to waste, the final battle has begun

After the downfall, a castle besieged
Facing the Nazis awaiting relief
Gangl and Lee and their men set the prisoners free

An it's the end of the line of the final journey
Enemies leaving the past
And it's American troops and the German army
Joining together at last

One last fight. It's the death throes of the 3rd Reich
Justice shall be done. The final battle remains

Ammo is running low, they're depleting their machine guns
Every bullet counts until surrender is announced

After the downfall, a castle relieved
Defeating the Nazis who held them besieged
Gangl and Lee and their men set the prisoners free

From the foot of the alps to the shores of the sea
From the foot of the alps to the shores of the sea
From the home of the brave, from the land of the free
From the foot of the alps to the shores of the sea


12. Camouflage

[originally by Stan Ridgway]

I was a PFC on search patrol huntin' Charlie down
It was the jungle wars of '65
My weapon jammed and I got stuck way out all alone
And I could hear the enemy movin' close outside

Just then I heard a twig snap and I grabbed my empty gun
And I dug in scared while I counted down my fate
And then a big marine with a pair of friendly eyes
Appeared there at my shoulder and said, "Wait.

If Charlie wants to tangle now he'll have two to dodge."
I said, "Well, thanks a lot."
I told him my name and asked him his
And he said, "The boys just call me Camouflage."

Whoa, Camouflage
Things are never quite the way they seem
Whoa, Camouflage
I was awfully glad to see this big marine

Well, we fought all night side by side, took our battle stance
And I wondered how the bullets missed this man
'Cause they seemed to go right through him as if he wasn't there
And in the mornin' we both took a chance and ran

And it was near the river bank when the ambush came
And I'd thought this was the end and we were had
Then a bullet with my name on came buzzin' through a bush
And the big marine—he just swatted it with his hand
Just like it was a fly

Whoa, Camouflage
Things are never quite the way they seem
Whoa, Camouflage
I was awfully glad to see this big marine

When he led me out of danger
I saw my camp and waved goodbye
He just winked at me from the jungle then was gone
And when I got back to my HQ, I told 'em about my night
And the battle I'd spent with a big marine named Camouflage

When I said his name a soldier gulped
And a medic took my arm
And led me to a green tent on the right
He said, "You may be tellin' the truth boy,
But this here is Camouflage,
And he's been right here since he passed away last night."

But before he went he said, "Semper Fi,"
And said his only wish
Was to save a young marine caught in a mirage
"So here, take his dog tag, son.
I know he'd want you to have it now."

Whoa, Camouflage
Things are never quite the way they seem
Whoa, Camouflage
I was awfully glad to see this big marine

Whoa, Camouflage
Things are never quite the way they seem
Whoa, Camouflage
This was an awfully big marine

Whoa, Camouflage
Things are never quite the way they seem
Whoa, Camouflage
This was an awfully big marine


13. All Guns Blazing

[originally by Judas Priest]

Twisting the strangle grip
Won't give no mercy
Feeling those tendons rip
Torn up and mean

Blastmaster racks the ground
Bent on survival
Full throttle hammers down
A deadly scream

All guns, all guns blazing

Forced into overdrive
Drawn out of anger
All talons poison dipped
Impaling spike

Heart pounding fever pitch
Blood pumping fury
Two-fisted dynamo
Eager to strike

All guns, all guns blazing

Cross cutting thundercharge
Blade of destruction
Flame throwing hurricane
Destroys the cage

Bone crushing alien
God of salvation
Sad wings that heaven sent
Wipes out in rage

All guns, all guns blazing

1. Bismarck

From the mist a shape, a ship is taking form
And the silence of the sea is about to drift into a storm
Sign of power, show of force
Raise the anchor battleship's plotting its course

Pride of a nation a beast made of steel
Bismarck in motion king of the ocean

He was made to rule the waves across the seven seas
To lead the warmachine
To rule the waves and lead the Kriegsmarine
The terror of the seas
The Bismarck and the Kriegsmarine

Two thousand men, and fifty thousand tonnes of steel
Set the course for the Atlantic with the allies on their heel
Firepower, firefight
Battlestations, keep the targets steady in sight

Into formation, the hunt has begun
Death and damnation, the fleet is coming

He was made to rule the waves across the seven seas
To lead the warmachine
To rule the waves and lead the Kriegsmarine
The terror of the seas
The Bismarck and the Kriegsmarine

At the bottom of the ocean the depths of the abyss
They are bound by iron and blood
The flagship of the navy the terror of the seas
His guns have gone silent at last

Pride of a nation a beast made of steel
Bismarck in motion king of the ocean

He was made to rule the waves across the seven seas
To lead the warmachine
To rule the waves and lead the Kriegsmarine
The terror of the seas
The Bismarck and the Kriegsmarine

To lead the warmachine
Rule the waves and lead the Kriegsmarine
The terror of the seas
Bismarck and the Kriegsmarine
To lead the warmachine
Rule the waves and lead the Kriegsmarine

The terror of the seas
Bismarck and the Kriegsmarine


1. The Future Of Warfare

Standing in the line of fire
32 will lead the way
Coming over trench and wire
Going through the endless grey

A desolate wasteland
Infernal depiction of Hell
The birth of a new way
September 15, 1916

The first wave approaches
At Flers-Courcelette
Through fire and brimstone
Breaking away, coming your way

Standing in the line of fire
32 will lead the way
Coming over trench and wire
Going through the endless grey

Standing in the line of fire
Moving on through the fray
Coming over trench and wire
Live to fight another day

The spell has been broken
A new way to wage war has come
The future of warfare
For all to be seen, 1918

The new world approaches
Villers-Bretonneux
Mechanized warfare
Breaking away, coming your way

Standing in the line of fire
32 will lead the way
Coming over trench and wire
Going through the endless grey

Standing in the line of fire
Moving on through the fray
Coming over trench and wire
Live to fight another day

2. Seven Pillars Of Wisdom

Far from home, a man with a mission
In the heat of the glistening sun
In the heart of ancient tradition
This man's journey has only begun

Lead the charge
A raider has entered the battlefield
Sabotage
The game is about to unfold

As the darkness falls and Arabia calls
One man spreads his wings, as the battle begins
May the land lay claim on to Lawrence name
Seven pillars of wisdom lights the flame

A revolt to gain independence
Hide and seek, hunters hot on their trail
Joined their ranks, obtained their acceptance
Side by side raid the Ottoman rail

Lead the charge
Tafilah, Medina, Damascus calls
Sabotage
Demolish the bridges to dust

As the darkness falls and Arabia calls
One man spreads his wings, as the battle begins
May the land lay claim on to Lawrence name
Seven pillars of wisdom lights the flame

After the war has been won, deception or treason?
Who can tell?
Who stood to gain?
Who stood to lose?
Who did the dying?
Betrayal of trust from within or compelled?
The pillars of wisdom can tell
Back home where a new life awaits, whispers of past
The sands of Arabia calling

As the darkness falls and Arabia calls
One man spreads his wings, as the battle begins
May the land lay claim on to Lawrence name
Seven pillars of wisdom lights the flame

As the darkness falls and Arabia calls
One man spreads his wings, as the battle begins
May the land lay claim on to Lawrence name
Seven pillars of wisdom lights the flame


3. 82nd All The Way

In the draft of 1917, a man from Tennessee
Overseas to the trenches he went, from the land of the free
Into war he brought two things along, a rifle and his faith
Joined the ranks as a private, assigned to 338th

There on that day, Alvin York
Entered the fray
Saving the day
82nd all the way

Into the fires of Hell, the Argonne, a hero to be
Entered the war from over the sea
Intervene, 1918, all the way from Tennessee
Hill 223

When his faith has been put to the test, the call to arms he heeds
On the 8th of October he went, made a sergeant for his deeds
Fearless, leading the raid of the war, machine gun on the hill
Charge the enemy taking the prisoners, by power of his will

There on that day, Sergeant York
Entered the fray
Saving the day
82nd all the way

Into the fires of Hell, the Argonne, a hero to be
Entered the war from over the sea
Intervene, 1918, all the way from Tennessee
Hill 223

What Sergeant York achieved that day
Would echo to the U.S.A.
It's 82nd all the way
Death from above, what they now say

What Sergeant York achieved that day
Echoes from France to the U.S.A.
It's 82nd all the way
Death from above, what they now say

Into the fires of Hell, the Argonne, a hero to be
Entered the war from over the sea
Intervene, 1918, all the way from Tennessee
Hill 223...

Hell, the Argonne, a hero to be
Entered the war from over the sea
Intervene, 1918, all the way from Tennessee
Hill 223


4. The Attack Of The Dead Men

Turmoil at the front
Wilhelms forces on the hunt
There's a thunder in the east
It's an attack of the deceased
They've been facing poison gas
7,000 charge en masse
Turn the tide of the attack
And force the enemy to turn back

And that's when the dead men are marching again

Osowiec then and again
Attack of the dead, hundred men
Facing the lead once again
Hundred men
Charge again
Die again

Osowiec then and again
Attack of the dead, hundred men
Facing the lead once again
Hundred men
Charge again
Die again

Two combatants spar
Hindenburg against the Tsar
Move in 12 battalions large
Into a Russian counter-charge
They'll be fighting for their lives
As their enemy revives
Russians won't surrender, no
Striking fear into their foe

And that's when the dead men are marching again

Osowiec then and again
Attack of the dead, hundred men
Facing the lead once again
Hundred men
Charge again
Die again

Osowiec then and again
Attack of the dead, hundred men
Facing the lead once again
Hundred men
Charge again
Die again

And that's when the dead men are marching again

Osowiec then and again
Attack of the dead, hundred men
Facing the lead once again
Hundred men
Charge again
Die again

Osowiec then and again
Attack of the dead, hundred men
Facing the lead once again
Hundred men
Charge again
Die again

That's when the dead men are marching again, marching again
That's when the dead march again


5. Devil Dogs

Kill, fight, die
That's what a soldier should do
Top of their game, earning their name
They were the Devil dogs
In a war machine
They were the USA marines

1918, USA intervene
Until now they were mainly observing
There in the wheat fields and a small piece of land
It's a battle that will write history

5 times attacked, and then 5 times repelled
At the 6th time they managed to break the line
Heart of the corps, and a part of the lore
The deadliest weapon on earth

Kill, fight, die
That's what a soldier should do
Top of their game, earning their name
They were the Devil dogs
In a war machine
They were the USA marines

Dogs lead ahead, and attack through the lead
Put to test, at the battle of Belleau
Clearing the forest and advance through the trees
It's the end of the war that's in sight

Hill 142, it's a final break through
It's the key to controlling the battlefield
Second to none, a marine and a gun
And the foes run in fear of their name

Kill, fight, die
That's what a soldier should do
Top of their game, earning their name
They were the Devil dogs
In a war machine
They were the USA marines

In times they are needed, such times they appear
When a leader has fallen, a hero arise
And inspire the lost into glorious deeds that
Would give them a name that live on to this day
When...

In times they are needed, such times they appear
When a leader has fallen, a hero arise
And inspire the lost into glorious deeds that
Would give them a name that live on to this day

"Come on, you sons of bitches, do you want to live forever?"

Second to none, a marine and a gun
Raising hell as they're fighting like dogs of war
Heart of the corps, and a part of the lore
The deadliest weapon on earth

Kill, fight, die
That's what a soldier should do
Top of their game, earning their name
They were the Devil dogs
In a war machine
They were the USA
And since then
They are the devil dogs of war
And then always
Are the USA marines


6. The Red Baron

Man and machine and nothing there in between
A flying circus and a man from Prussia
The sky and a plane, this man commands his domain
The western front and all the way to Russia

Death from above, you're under fire
Stained red as blood, he's roaming higher

Born a soldier from the horseback to the skies
That's where the legend will arise

And he's flying

Higher, the king of the sky
He's flying too fast and he's flying too high
Higher, an eye for an eye
The legend will never die

First to the scene he is a lethal machine
It's bloody April and the tide is turning
Fire at will it is the thrill of the kill
Four in a day shot down with engines burning

Embrace the fame, red squadron leader
Call out his name, Rote Kampfflieger

In the game to win, a gambler rolls the dice
Eighty allies paid the price

And he's flying

Higher, the king of the sky
He's flying too fast and he's flying to high
Higher, an eye for an eye
The legend will never die

Higher
Higher, the king of the sky
He's flying too fast and he's flying too high
He's flying higher, an eye for an eye
The legend will never die

Higher

Born a soldier from the horseback to the skies
And the legend never dies

And he's flying
And he's flying
And he's flying

Higher, the king of the sky
He's flying too fast and he's flying too high
Higher, an eye for an eye
The legend will never die

Higher, the king of the sky
He's flying too fast and he's flying too high
Higher, an eye for an eye
The legend will never die


7. Great War

Where dead men lies I'm paralyzed, my brothers' eyes are gone
And he shall be buried here, nameless marks his grave
Mother home, get a telegram and shed a tear of grief
Mud and blood, in foreign land, trying to understand

Where is this greatness I've been told?
This is the lies that we been sold
Is this a worthy sacrifice?

Great war
And I cannot take more
Great tour
I keep on marching on
I play the great score
There will be no encore
Great War
The war to end all wars

I'm standing here, I'm full of fear, with bodies at my feet
Over there in the other trench, bullets wear my name
Lead ahead, as the captain said and show them no remorse
Who am I to understand what have I become?

I do my duties, pay the price
I'll do the worthy sacrifice
I know my deeds are not in vain

Great war
And I cannot take more
Great tour
I keep on marching on
I play the great score
There will be no encore
Great War
The war to end all wars

And feet by feet
We pay the price of a mile here
Though men are falling, we see Heroes rise
We face the heat
As we are fighting until the dawn
So follow me and we will write our own history

Great war
And I cannot take more
Great tour
I keep on marching on
I play the great score
There will be no encore
Great War
The war to end all wars


8. A Ghost In The Trenches

Move between the lines, a soldier breaking the confines

A force deployed from overseas
A war in foreign land await the eager recruits
And in their midst, among the men
A soldier with a different past return to his roots

Into battle, the gas has them pinned
Then this soldier invoke the spirits of the wind

Under fire, a ghost that roams the battlefield
Move between the lines, a soldier breaking the confines
Just another man and rifle, a marksman and a scout revealed
Makes his way from trench to trench alone, moving undetected

And on the fields of Passchendaele
A guiding light for reinforcements finding their way
And in the Battle of the Scarpe
Bring ammo over no man's land and fire away

In the battle, the gas had them pinned
Pegahmagabow invoked the spirits of the wind

Under fire, a ghost that roams the battlefield
Move between the lines, a soldier breaking the confines
Just another man and rifle, a marksman and a scout revealed
Makes his way from trench to trench alone, moving undetected

Under fire, a ghost that...
Under fire, a ghost that roams the battlefield
Move between the lines, a soldier breaking the confines
Just another man and rifle, a marksman and a scout revealed
Makes his way from trench to trench alone, moving undetected

Francis stayed and fought throughout the war, made his way until the end alive


9. Fields Of Verdun

As the drum roll started on that day
Heard a hundred miles away
A million shells were fired
And the green fields turned to grey
The bombardment lasted all day long
Yet the forts were standing strong
Heavily defended
Now the trap's been sprung
And the battle's begun

Descend into darkness
303 days below the sun

Fields of Verdun
And the battle has begun
Nowhere to run
Father and son
Fall one by one
Under the gun
Thy will be done
And the judgement has begun
Nowhere to run
Father and son
Fall one by one
Fields of Verdun

Though a million shells have scarred the land
No one has the upper hand
From the ground above to trenches
Where the soldiers make their stand
As the trenches slowly turn to mud
And then quickly start to flood
Death awaits in every corner
As they die in the mud
Fill the trenches with blood

Descend into darkness
303 days below the sun

Fields of Verdun
And the battle has begun
Nowhere to run
Father and son
Fall one by one
Under the gun
Thy will be done
And the judgement has begun
Nowhere to run
Father and son
Fall one by one
Fields of Verdun

Fields of execution turned to wasteland from the grass
Thou shalt go no further. It was said, "They shall not pass!"
The spirit of resistance and the madness of the war
So go ahead!
Face the lead!
Join the dead!
Though you die!
Where you lie!
Never asking why!

Descend into darkness
303 days below the sun

Fields of Verdun
And the battle has begun
Nowhere to run
Father and son
Fall one by one
Under the gun
Thy will be done
And the judgement has begun
Nowhere to run
Father and son
Fall one by one
Fields of Verdun


10. The End Of The War To End All Wars

Death, hard to ignore
One million lost five months into the war

Pain, fell one by one
Three years remained, it had only begun

Unable to restore
A map redrawn
Unlike what came before
The future of warfare has dawned

Do, what must be done
Send off your son, life cut short by a gun

Gas, cover the fields
Gone with the wind, reveal lethal ideals

And as the end draws near
November dawn
With losses so severe
Cease-fire, their forces withdrawn

Great war enter
Front and centre
Grand endeavour
Lost forever

Great war enter
Front and centre
Grand endeavour
Lost forever

And as the end draws near
November dawn
With losses so severe
Cease-fire, their forces withdrawn

November 11th settling the score
From 15 to 20 million
Almost half of the dead civilian
A new world will dawn from empires fallen
The end of the war to end war


11. In Flanders Fields

In Flanders fields, the poppies blow
Between the crosses, row on row
That mark our place; and in the sky
The larks, still bravely singing, fly
Scarce heard amid the guns below

We are the dead, short days ago
We lived, felt dawn, saw sunset glow
Loved, and were loved, and now we lie
In Flanders fields In Flanders fields
And now we lie In Flanders fields

Take up our quarrel with the foe:
To you from failing hands we throw
The torch; be yours to hold it high
If ye break faith with us who die
We shall not sleep, though poppies grow
In Flanders fields In Flanders fields
We shall not sleep, though poppies grow
In Flanders fields In Flanders fields
(Flanders Fields)

1. Sarajevo

[Physical Edition Bonus Track]

For decades the Austro-Hungarian empire had been a
Powerful influence in the heart of Europe
Resting on a legacy, their house kept stability, order and peace
But not everyone bowed to this power

In the summer of 1914 the archduke Franz Ferdinand of the empire
Is visiting Sarajevo, unaware of the assassins awaiting him, and what will come

Two shots are fired and the archduke is dead

The empire cannot let this go unpunished
And the first declaration of war is made

From a shot that would change the world
Tensions rise and a war is unfurled
Nothing like what had come before
It's the war that will end all war!

Chaos and shockwaves spread from the Balkans across the globe
Alliances are put to the test, threats exchanged and armies are put on high alert
In the east the Russian Tsar is trying to calm the situation with his cousin
The Kaiser of Germany

But it is all in vain, the situation is out of control
War is unavoidable

The Battle of the Frontiers starts in August
As soldiers cross borders and bullets are fired in rage

War begins


2. Stormtroopers

Now there's a standstill in the war, repeating what's been done before
It must come to an end, a few will transcend
They were under twenty five, and under fire they would thrive
The Sturmmann is born, their enemies scorn
A glimpse of the future, new tactics in war
New doctrine in combat explored

As fast as lightning, there's no time to mourn
A glimpse of the future and Blitzkrieg is born

Strike at zero hour
With overwhelming firepower
They're fueled by the fear in their enemies eyes
It's a shock troop infiltration
A fast and violent escalation
Out of the trenches the stormtroopers rise

Jägers led the way, the pioneers would join the fray
Initiative gained, advancement sustained
Lead through direct command, as they're advancing through the land
Encircling their flanks, and ravage their ranks
Expose their reinforcements, destroying their lines
New doctrine in combat aligns
Infantry attacks, exposing the cracks
New combat ideals, on the Kaiserschlacht's fields

Strike at zero hour
With overwhelming firepower
They're fueled by the fear in their enemies eyes
It's a shock troop infiltration
A fast and violent escalation
Out of the trenches the stormtroopers rise

A glimpse of the future, new tactics in war
New doctrine in combat explored

As fast as lightning, there's no time to mourn
A glimpse of the future and Blitzkrieg is born

Strike at zero hour
With overwhelming firepower
They're fueled by the fear in their enemies eyes
It's a shock troop infiltration
A fast and violent escalation
Out of the trenches the stormtroopers rise
Strike at zero hour
With overwhelming firepower
They're fueled by the fear in their enemies eyes
It's a shock troop infiltration
A fast and violent escalation
Out of the trenches the stormtroopers rise


3. Dreadnought

A shadow moves across the water in pursuit
It splits the waves, commands the sea and defies the wind
Instilling fear among its prey, feels nought for itself
Ahead the sea lies calm awaiting the storm

Displace the water in its path
Reveal the cannons, align the guns, unleash their wrath

Unopposed under crimson skies
Immortalized, over time their legend will rise
And their foes can't believe their eyes, believe their size, as they fall
And the dreadnoughts dread nothing at all

A hull of steel and all big guns to serve the fleet
Unrivalled firepower riding the waves to war
A devastating blow will send their foes down below
Fearless armada now bombarding their shore

Light up the night when cannons roar
In fear of nothing, they lead the navy into war

Unopposed under crimson skies
Immortalized, over time their legend will rise
And their foes can't believe their eyes, believe their size, as they fall
And the dreadnoughts dread nothing at all

The North Sea has drawn them near
The Fleet of the High Seas approach
A contest of titans commence
These days will dictate their fate
The grand fleet prepares their guns
Unleashed as the dreadnoughts clash at last

Unopposed under crimson skies
Immortalized, over time their legend will rise
And their foes can't believe their eyes, believe their size, as they fall
And the dreadnoughts dread nothing at all


4. The Unkillable Soldier

Into the fire through trenches and mud
Son of Belgium and Ireland with war in his blood
Leading the charge into hostile barrage
By design, he was made for the frontline

Studied law, with a thirst for war
Fought in Africa, wanted more
Back in Europe then straight to France
He's joining the allied advance
Through the Somme and the Devil's Wood
All the battles that he withstood
Born a soldier, enjoyed the war
He always kept coming for more

Never die, shot through the eye
Never surrender however they try
How they try, shot through the eye
He'll never die

At the edge of madness, in a time of sadness
An immortal soldier finds his home
Proven under fire, over trench and wire
No fear of death, he's unshakeable

In the battles, when he was shot
Kept on fighting, and never stopped
In Arras, Cambrai, Passchendaele
Ignoring his wounds he prevailed
Save the day, he'll never stray
Facing the foes that are coming his way
Come his way, he'll never stray
Saving the day

At the edge of madness, in a time of sadness
An immortal soldier finds his home
Proven under fire, over trench and wire
Forged for the war, he's unbreakable
At the edge of madness, he will show no sadness
Never broken, he'll be back for more
Proven under fire, over trench and wire
No fear of death, he's unshakeable

Into the fire through trenches and mud
Son of Belgium and Ireland with war in his blood
Leading the charge into hostile barrage
By design, he was made for the frontline

Never die, shot through the eye
Never surrender however they try
How they try, shot through the eye
He'll never die

At the edge of madness, in a time of sadness
An immortal soldier, edge of madness
At the edge of madness, in a time of sadness
An immortal soldier, finds his home
Proven under fire, over trench and wire
Forged for the war, he's unbreakable
At the edge of madness, he will show no sadness
Never broken, he'll be back for more
Proven under fire, over trench and wire
No fear of death, he is forged for the war, he will always be coming for more


5. Soldier Of Heaven

I won't be coming home
I won't be going anywhere
I will guard this post forever
Here on the alpine slope, where I did my final stand I shall remain
Among the ice and snow that binds me to this mountain

A force of nature too strong, sent from above
Where spirits lead the way, the winds will never fade

White Friday, I'll take the
Stairway to heaven
I'm sky high, when I die
I'll be immortal
Forever, I never
I won't return to
Blood mountain, I am the
Soldier of heaven

I saw the end of war
I watched the soldiers come and go
And I kept my watch forever
So many brave men fell in the battles that were raging down below
I have seen it all but none will hear my story
All of these years I have been frozen in time
I cried for spring to come but here, winter remain

White Friday, I'll take the
Stairway to heaven
I'm sky high, when I die
I'll be immortal
Forever, I never
I won't return to
Blood mountain, I am the
Soldier of heaven

I always dreamed that I would, serve high above
Where spirits lead the way, the winds will never fade

White Friday, I'll take the
Stairway to heaven
I'm sky high, when I die
I'll be immortal
Forever, I never
I won't return to
Blood mountain, I am the
Soldier of heaven

White Friday, I'll take the
Stairway to heaven
I'm sky high, when I die
I'll be immortal
Forever, I never
I won't return to
Blood mountain, I am the
Soldier of heaven


6. Hellfighters

From a land across the ocean, to the western front where they served
Fought with courage and devotion, preconceptions turned
As the spring offensive kept churning, where the men would earn their name
See the tides of battle turning, and their foes ignite their flame

Hear the toll of the bell, kept fighting for 6 months in hell
As the war rages on, they fight at the edge of the Argonne

Hear the toll of the bell, over 6 months in hell
Out of the trenches they came
As the war rages on, at the edge of the Argonne
Hellfighters earning their name

They would have no prisoners taken, and they never lost any ground
Earned the cross of war unshaken, never turned around
As the armistice is drawing closer, the 369th
Kept on fighting until it was over, and they were first to reach the Rhine

Hear the toll of the bell, kept fighting for 6 months in hell
As the war rages on, they fight at the edge of the Argonne

Hear the toll of the bell, over 6 months in hell
Out of the trenches they came
As the war rages on, at the edge of the Argonne
Hellfighters earning their name

Hear the toll of the bell, over 6 months in hell
Out of the trenches they came
As the war rages on, at the edge of the Argonne
Hellfighters earning their name


7. Race To The Sea

We're keeping the kingdom free

As an archduke falls and the battle horn calls, our lives would never be the same
We were looking down barrel of a gun
Now the war has come and the battle has begun, we are desperate and overrun
To the war drum we'll be marching until it's done

Lead the way, we will follow into the fray
We will hold the line we will not be led astray

For king and for country, we are flooding the river
Our stand at Yser will be, the end of the race to the sea
The last piece of Belgium is free, we're keeping a sliver
A cog in the war machine, October of 1914

As our foe draws forth we are moving on north, we will never let them have it all
There's a price for freedom paid by Belgiums sons
They may take our towns, they may conquer our grounds we'll defend the nation and the crown
We'll uphold our independence with our guns

All the way, on to triumph or to judgement day
We will follow and we will not be led astray

For king and for country, we are flooding the river
Our stand at Yser will be, the end of the race to the sea
The last piece of Belgium is free, we're keeping a sliver
A cog in the war machine, October of 1914

See a king and a soldier, fighting shoulder to shoulder
See a king and a soldier, fighting shoulder to shoulder
He overruled his commanders, he made a last stand in Flanders
We see our king and a soldier, they're fighting shoulder to shoulder
To keep the last piece of Belgium free

All the way, on to triumph or to judgement day
We will follow and we will not be led astray

For king and for country, we are flooding the river
Our stand at Yser will be, the end of the race to the sea
The last piece of Belgium is free, we're keeping a sliver
A cog in the war machine, October of 1914
For king and for country, we are flooding the river
Our stand at Yser will be, the end of the race to the sea
We're free
For king and for country we are flooding the river
No more of our country lost, the line will be held at all cost


8. Lady Of The Dark

Who shall be remembered
In the ancient house of war?
All the medals, all those stories
In the alley of the greats
Celebrated hero, who has wandered through the dark
She stand before you, all that metal shining bright

Lost in time, returning to the light
Bow before, this lady fight for life
So sister

Raise your hand
For the lady of the dark
Soldier with no will to kill, with a philanthropic heart
Forever
Break the norm
She's the girl in uniform
Fighting side by side with men, she will fight until the end

Lied to be respected
And to change her brothers fate
Took a bullet, earned her freedom
And a place among the stars
And she served the Iron squadron, served the toughest of them all
No fear of dying, for the frontline she was born

Sacrifice, she took her brothers place
War to war, a place where she belong
So brother

Raise your hand
For the lady of the dark
Soldier with no will to kill, with a philanthropic heart
Forever
Break the norm
She's the girl in uniform
Fighting side by side with men, she will fight until the end

Don't fear the reaper
Don't fear the war
She spared the life of brothers
She'll fight for honour
She'll fight for life
A lady goes to war

Raise your hand
For the lady of the dark
Raise your hand
For the lady of the dark
Soldier with no will to kill, with a philanthropic heart
Forever
Break the norm
She's the girl in uniform
Fighting side by side with men, she will fight until the end


9. The Valley Of Death

Dug in deep, equipped for attack
Outnumbered, determined to win
Double trench lines that won't give in
They're prepared let the battle begin
Here again they've done this before
A lesson that they should have learned by now
Reinforced with new men and guns
Who are ready for death when it comes

United they're strong, united they're holding the line
The Valley of Death, awaiting the British as they come their way

Their attack is coming fight them back
Bulgarians holding the line
Facing wave after wave, will never surrender
Again, again, again, again
They attack, Bulgaria held them back
Unleash their counter barrage
Let it rain artillery pounding the trenches
No surrender, fight them until the end

Fortified, and made to defy
Protected by wires and guns
Troops as far as the eye can see
They advance under Vazovs command
Row on row, as they come from below
Twice they attack, twice they're beaten back
Every time they try, they will die
Their line of defence is still intact
For white, green and red, for the nation they're fighting for
The British are done, three times the defence of Doiran has been won

Their attack is coming fight them back
Bulgarians holding the line
Facing wave after wave, will never surrender
Again, again, again, again
They attack, Bulgaria held them back
Unleash their counter barrage
Let it rain artillery pounding the trenches
No surrender, fight them until the end

For white, green and red, for the nation they're fighting for
The British are done, three times the defence of Doiran has been won

Their attack is coming fight them back
Bulgarians holding the line
Facing wave after wave, will never surrender
Again, again, again, again
They attack, Bulgaria held them back
Unleash their counter barrage
Let it rain artillery pounding the trenches
No surrender, fight them until the end


10. Christmas Truce

Silence
Oh, I remember the silence
On a cold winter day
After many months on the battlefield
And we were used to the violence
Then all the cannons went silent
And the snow fell
Voices sang to me from no man's land

We are all, we are all, we are all, we are all friends

And today we're all brothers, tonight we're all friends
A moment of peace in a war that never ends
Today we're all brothers, we drink and unite
Now Christmas has arrived and the snow turns the ground white
Hear carols from the trenches, we sing O Holy Night
Our guns laid to rest among snowflakes
A Christmas in the trenches, a Christmas on the front far from home

Madness (Madness)
Oh I remember the sadness (Sadness)
We were hiding our tears (Hiding our tears)
In a foreign land where we faced our fears (Faced our fears)
We were soldiers (Soldiers)
Carried the war on our shoulders (Shoulders)
For our nations (Nations)
Is that why we bury our friends? (Bury our friends)

We were all, we were all, we were all, we were all friends
(We're friends)

And today we're all brothers, tonight we're all friends
A moment of peace in a war that never ends
Today we're all brothers, we drink and unite
Now Christmas has arrived and the snow turns the ground white
Hear carols from the trenches, we sing O Holy Night
Our guns laid to rest among snowflakes
A Christmas in the trenches, a Christmas on the front far from home

We were all, we were all, we were all, we were all friends
(We're friends)

And today we're all brothers, tonight we're all friends
A moment of peace in a war that never ends
Today we're all brothers, we drink and unite
Now Christmas has arrived and the snow turns the ground white
A Christmas on the frontline, we walk among our friends
We don't think about tomorrow, the battle will commence
When we celebrated Christmas we thought about our friends
Those who never made it home when the battle had commenced


11. Versailles

The war had been raging and ravaging for four years
Leaving millions of casualties from all sides
In the trenches of the frontlines, people have asked the question
What is the price of peace?
How many more must die?
Exactly five years after the assassination of Franz Ferdinand
Germany is forced to sign an unconditional surrender
For the signing of this historical document, the French city of Versailles is chosen

Signed a treaty to change the world
Tensions fall and a peace unfurled
Nothing like what had come before
It's the deal, it's the treaty that will end the war!

Signed a treaty to change the world
Tensions fall and a peace unfurled
Nothing like what had come before
It's the deal, it's the treaty that will end the war!

A fragile but hopeful peace falls upon the European continent
America returns to their shores, Russia tend to their own matters
And the British Empire disbands their colonial forces
Parades are being held in victorious countries
The war that would end all wars is over
But not everyone agrees
In the underground, something is growing in the dark
Because for some, the war never ended
War will never entirely die, it will evolve
It will change
And war will return, sooner than we think

Signed a treaty to change the world
Tensions fall and a peace unfurled
Nothing like what had come before
It's the deal, it's the treaty that will end the war!

Signed a treaty to change the world
Tensions fall and a peace unfurled
Nothing like what had come before
It's the deal, it's the treaty that will end the war!

From a shot that would change the world
Tensions rise and a war is unfurled
Nothing like what had come before
It's the war that will end all war!

From a shot that would change the world
Tensions rise and a war is unfurled
Nothing like what had come before
It's the war that will end all war!

Will this war really end all wars?
Can a war really end all war?
Will this war bring another war?
It's the war that will end all wars

Will this war really end all wars?
Can a war really end all war?
Will this war bring another war?
It's the war that will end all wars

Will this war really end all wars?
Can a war really end all war?
Will this war bring another war?
It's the war that will end all wars

Will this war really end all wars?
Can a war really end all war?
Will this war bring another war?
It's the war that will end all wars
